Similar to the initial wave of digital audio-visual content at the turn of the millennium, the demand for intellectual property protection is also increasing, since explicit and editable 3D parameterization makes unauthorized use and dissemination easier. In this position paper, we argue that effective progress in watermarking 3D assets requires articulated security objectives and realistic threat models, incorporating the lessons learned from digital audio-visual asset protection over the past decades. To address this gap in security specification and evaluation, we advocate a scenario-driven formulation, in which adversarial capabilities are formalized through a security model. Based on this formulation, we construct a reference framework that organizes existing methods and clarifies how specific design choices map to corresponding adversarial assumptions. Within this framework, we also examine a legacy spread-spectrum embedding scheme, characterizing its advantages and limitations and highlighting the important trade-offs it entails. Overall, this work aims to foster effective intellectual property protection for 3D assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D\u5185\u5bb9\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5f3a\u53163D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cAI\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5230\u6765\uff0c3D\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u800c3DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u9752\u7750\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a3D\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u66f4\u52a0\u5bb9\u6613\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5047\u8bbe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd8\u5bf9\u4e00\u79cd\u9057\u7559\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6269\u5c55\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Although the ethical principles of consent - providing information, ensuring comprehension, and ensuring voluntariness - are well-defined, the technological infrastructure remains outdated. Clinicians are responsible for obtaining informed consent from research subjects or patients, and for managing it before, during, and after clinical trials or care, which is a burden for them. The voluntary nature of participating in clinical research or undergoing medical treatment implies the need for a participant-centric consent management system. However, this is not reflected in most established systems. Not only do most healthcare information systems not follow a user-centric model, but they also create data silos, which significantly reduce the mobility of patient data between different healthcare institutions and impact personalized medicine. Furthermore, consent management tools are outdated. We propose ClinConNet (Clinical Consent Network), a platform that connects researchers and participants based on clinical research projects. ClinConNet is powered by a dynamic consent model based on blockchain and take advantage of dynamic consent interfaces, as well as blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity systems. ClinConNet is user-centric and provides important privacy features for patients, such as unlinkability, confidentiality, and ownership of identity data. It is also compatible with the right to be forgotten, as defined in many personal data protection regulations, such as the GDPR. We provide a detailed privacy and security analysis in an adversarial model, as well as a Proof of Concept implementation with detailed performance measures that demonstrate the feasibility of our blockchain-based consent management system with a median end-to-end consent establishment time of under 200ms and a throughput of 250TPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "ClinConNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u540c\u610f\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540c\u610f\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u843d\u540e\u7684\u540c\u610f\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u540c\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u7684 ClinConNet\u5e73\u53f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "ClinConNet\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u540c\u610f\u754c\u9762\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4e3b\u6743\u8eab\u4efd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "result": "ClinConNet\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u6027\u5982\u533f\u540d\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u6570\u636e\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7b49\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u6bcf\u8bbf\u95ee\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4f4e\u4e8e200\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230250TPS\u3002", "conclusion": "ClinConNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b3e\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u540c\u610f\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes.

This paper proposes TinyGuard, a lightweight Byzantine defense that augments the standard FedAvg algorithm via statistical update f ingerprinting. Instead of operating directly on high-dimensional gradients, TinyGuard extracts compact statistical fingerprints cap turing key behavioral properties of client updates, including norm statistics, layer-wise ratios, sparsity measures, and low-order mo ments. Byzantine clients are identified by measuring robust sta tistical deviations in this low-dimensional fingerprint space with nd complexity, without modifying the underlying optimization procedure. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, ViT-Lite, and ViT-Small with LoRA adapters demonstrate that TinyGuard pre serves FedAvg convergence in benign settings and achieves up to 95 percent accuracy under multiple Byzantine attack scenarios, including sign-flipping, scaling, noise injection, and label poisoning. Against adaptive white-box adversaries, Pareto frontier analysis across four orders of magnitude confirms that attackers cannot simultaneously evade detection and achieve effective poisoning, features we term statistical handcuffs. Ablation studies validate stable detection precision 0.8 across varying client counts (50-150), threshold parameters and extreme data heterogeneity .

However, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA have created data silos that prevent centralized training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. Despite its potential, FL remains vulnerable to poisoning and Sybil attacks, in which malicious participants corrupt the global model or infiltrate the network using fake identities. While recent approaches integrate Blockchain technology for auditability, they predominantly rely on probabilistic reputation systems rather than robust cryptographic identity verification. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning (TBFL) framework integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our architecture ensures only authenticated healthcare entities contribute to the global model. Through comprehensive evaluation using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we demonstrate that anchoring trust in cryptographic identity verification rather than behavioral patterns significantly mitigates security risks while maintaining clinical utility. Our results show the framework successfully neutralizes 100% of Sybil attacks, achieves robust predictive performance (AUC = 0.954, Recall = 0.890), and introduces negligible computational overhead (<0.12%). The approach provides a secure, scalable, and economically viable ecosystem for inter-institutional health data collaboration, with total operational costs of approximately $18 for 100 training rounds across multiple institutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTBFL\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u4e3b\u6743\u8eab\u4efd\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u6709\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u8d21\u732e\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6TBFL\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4e3b\u6743\u8eab\u4efd\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51ed\u8bc1\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTBFL\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51ed\u8bc1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684Sybil\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC = 0.954\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387 = 0.890\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u5c0f\uff08\u4e0d\u52300.12%\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6570\u91cf robust\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations.

Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations.

In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs.

Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We prove necessary and sufficient conditions that must be added to ensure linear composition for Pufferfish mechanisms, hence avoiding such privacy collapse. These extra conditions turn out to be differential privacy-style inequalities, indicating that achieving both the interpretable semantics of Pufferfish for correlated data and composition benefits requires adopting differentially private mechanisms to Pufferfish. We show that such translation is possible through a concept called the $(a,b)$-influence curve, and many existing differentially private algorithms can be translated with our framework into a composable Pufferfish algorithm.

However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification.\n  In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives.\n  We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\\mathcal{B}_{\\infty}$, total delay $\\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\\%$) while touching fewer than $2\\%$ of spikes under $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.

To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning.

By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $\u03a9(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds.

In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced.

However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u627f\u8ba4\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1(SATD)\u8865\u5145\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177(SAT)\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3SAT\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0SATD\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u627f\u8ba4\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709SATD\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e572\u540d\u5b89\u5168\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709SAT\u5de5\u5177\u5171\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86135\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7684SATD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684114\u4e2a\uff0c\u6db5\u76d624\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff08CWE\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d6\u4e2a\u662fSAT\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e38\u7528SAT\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408SATD\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6839\u9664\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u9002\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7684SATD\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f25\u8865SAT\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits.\n  We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets.

This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u503c\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6765\u907f\u5f00\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee5\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9759\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f02\u79fb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u6f14\u53d8\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb6\u65cf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We propose \\emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed.

Causal Reasoning as a Function of Prior Knowledge, Irrelevant Information, and Reasoning Budget", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \\!\\rightarrow\\! E\\! \\leftarrow \\!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8620\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u51e0\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u89c4\u5219\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e0d\u663e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u6709\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u8be6\u7ec6\u89e3\u91ca\u6216\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u6bd4\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6240\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u662f\u5426\u9075\u5faa\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5176\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08C1 \u2192 E \u2190 C2\uff09\u4e0b\u768411\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u79cdLLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u906d\u9047\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u8f7d\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u8f83\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8003\u8651\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5e76\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5f31\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u8fdd\u53cd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5f53\u589e\u52a0\u8be6\u7ec6\u89e3\u91ca\u6216\u6ce8\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e86\u89e3LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

For security smell detection, on the Stack Overflow dataset, which primarily contains small, simplified code snippets, the models detected at least 71% of security smells when prompted to analyze code from a security perspective (general prompt). With a guided prompt (adding clear, step-by-step instructions), this increased to 78%.In GitHub repositories, which contain complete, real-world project scripts, a general prompt was less effective, leaving more than half of the smells undetected. However, with the guided prompt, the models uncovered at least 67% of the smells. For secure code generation, we prompted LLMs with 89 vulnerable synthetic scenarios and observed that only 7% of the generated scripts were secure. Adding an explicit instruction to generate secure code increased GPT secure output rate to 17%, while Gemini changed little (8%).

We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences.

In order to protect users' rights to informational self-determination, regulatory approaches for the collection and processing of personal data have been developed, such as the EU's GDPR. However, inspecting the compliance of mobile apps with privacy regulations remains difficult. Thus, in order to enable end users and enforcement bodies to verify and enforce data protection compliance, we propose mopri, a conceptual framework designed for analyzing the behavior of mobile apps through a comprehensive, adaptable, and user-centered approach. Recognizing the gaps in existing frameworks, mopri serves as a foundation for integrating various analysis tools into a streamlined, modular pipeline that employs static and dynamic analysis methods. Building on this concept, a prototype has been developed which effectively extracts permissions and tracking libraries while employing robust methods for dynamic traffic recording and decryption. Additionally, it incorporates result enrichment and reporting features that enhance the clarity and usability of the analysis outcomes. The prototype showcases the feasibility of a holistic and modular approach to privacy analysis, emphasizing the importance of continuous adaptation to the evolving challenges presented by the mobile app ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3amopri\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u6cbb\u6743\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u679c\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u670d\u52a1\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51famopri\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u548c\u6267\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "method": "mopri\u6846\u67b6\u7efc\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u6743\u9650\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u89e3\u5bc6\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u539f\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u6743\u9650\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u89e3\u5bc6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "mopri\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u6311\u6218\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.\n  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53ef\u5fae\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5236\u5b9a\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u673a\u5236\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u5fae\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7eb3\u5165\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u7406\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u8861\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u673a\u5236\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u9700\u4f18\u5148\u89e3\u51b3\u768436\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u53ef\u5fae\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b66\u79d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u3002"}}

Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand.

Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%.

However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments.

Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control.

This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set.

However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse.

Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong.

However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes.

To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records.

We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops.

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines.

Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents.
