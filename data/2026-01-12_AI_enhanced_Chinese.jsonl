Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels.

By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u6846\u67b6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u52a0\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8f83\u65e9\u4ee3\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u52a0\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u7279\u6027\u8d4b\u4e88LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u6218\u7565\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u91cf\u8868\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u79cd\u4eba\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81f3\u6781\u503c\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u662f\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5728\u8f83\u65e9\u4ee3\u6b21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6613\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f83\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u5e95\u7269\u3001\u9176\u3001\u4ea7\u7269\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff08Hyper-Enz\uff09\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff08KGE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u914d\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff08\u5e95\u7269\uff0c\u9176\uff0c\u4ea7\u7269\uff09\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff08KGE\uff09\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u5bf9\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0eKGE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\uff08Hyper-Enz\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9176\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe88%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8630%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\u03ba= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

These highly intelligent models, capable of performing multi-modal tasks with high accuracy, are also severely susceptible to carefully launched security attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, which can manipulate model behavior and bypass safety constraints. This paper introduces MJAD-MLLMs, a holistic framework that systematically analyzes the proposed Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks and multi-LLM-based defense techniques for MLLMs. In this paper, we make three original contributions. First, we introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack to exploit the vulnerabilities of the MLLMs under multi-turn prompting. Second, we propose a novel fragment-optimized and multi-LLM defense mechanism, called FragGuard, to effectively mitigate jailbreaking attacks in the MLLMs. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks and defenses through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source MLLMs and benchmark datasets, and compare their performance with the existing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMJAD-MLLMs\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9488\u5bf9MLLMs\u7684\u591aLLM\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFragGuard\u7684\u788e\u7247\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591aLLM\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6210\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5982\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u4ee5\u64cd\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51faMJAD-MLLMs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\u4ee5\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFragGuard\u7684\u788e\u7247\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591aLLM\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u5c01\u95ed\u6e90\u7684\u5148\u8fdbMLLMs\u53ca\u5176\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u63d0\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14FragGuard\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u76d1\u72f1\u7a81\u7834\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591aLLM\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3aMLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, the practical effectiveness of existing attacks is undermined by several critical limitations: they struggle to maintain a coherent progression over long interactions, often losing track of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done; they rely on rigid or pre-defined patterns, and fail to adapt to the LLM's dynamic and unpredictable conversational state. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings. Moreover, our framework exhibits notable resilience against multiple advanced defense mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mastermind \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u6539\u5584\u5176\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u62b5\u5fa1\u591a\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\u7f3a\u9677\uff0cMastermind \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Mastermind \u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u91cd\u7ec4\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Mastermind \u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5371\u5bb3\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Mastermind \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6b21\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9632\u8303\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies.

Recent work demonstrated that the MINJA (Memory Injection Attack) achieves over 95 % injection success rate and 70 % attack success rate under idealized conditions. However, the robustness of these attacks in realistic deployments and effective defensive mechanisms remain understudied. This work addresses these gaps through systematic empirical evaluation of memory poisoning attacks and defenses in Electronic Health Record (EHR) agents. We investigate attack robustness by varying three critical dimensions: initial memory state, number of indication prompts, and retrieval parameters. Our experiments on GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models using MIMIC-III clinical data reveal that realistic conditions with pre-existing legitimate memories dramatically reduce attack effectiveness. We then propose and evaluate two novel defense mechanisms: (1) Input/Output Moderation using composite trust scoring across multiple orthogonal signals, and (2) Memory Sanitization with trust-aware retrieval employing temporal decay and pattern-based filtering.

However, advancements in quantum computing threaten the security of classical cryptographic schemes, jeopardizing blockchain integrity once cryptographic quantum supremacy is achieved. This milestone, defined here as the realization of quantum computers to solve practical cryptographic problems, would render existing security standards vulnerable, exposing blockchain assets (currency, data, etc.) to fraud and theft. To address this risk, we propose and implement a smart contract deployable on the Ethereum blockchain, having the ability to run applications on its blockchain, that generates classically intractable puzzles by probabilistically generating large, hard-to-factor numbers without requiring secret information. This contract then serves two purposes: to establish a mechanism (1) for a trustless, unbiased proof of cryptographic quantum supremacy by verifying solutions to these puzzles, and (2) to protect user funds on Ethereum by triggering quantum-secure fallback protocols upon detecting cryptographic quantum supremacy, since it is desirable to wait as long as possible to fall back to a quantum-secure scheme because of its inherent additional cost and complexity. These mechanisms demonstrate the ability to identify cryptographic vulnerabilities and ensure a smooth transition to quantum-secure standards, safeguarding blockchain assets in a post-quantum era.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm.

We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.", "AI": {"tldr": "WildSci \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u79d1\u548c26\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u591a\u9009\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0cWildSci \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "WildSci \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6587\u732e\u5408\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e869\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u79d1\u548c26\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9009\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91ce\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u901a\u8fc7 WildSci \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cWildSci \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GSPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u652f\u4ed8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9762\u4e34\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bc8\u9a97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u91d1\u878d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GSPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u529f\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u7684\u65b0\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b (SCMs) \u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) \u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4ec5\u7ea0\u6b63\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u503e\u5411\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u5269\u4f59\u504f\u89c1\u6216\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b (SCMs) \u6765\u6307\u5b9a\u70b9\u51fb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u6cc4\u9732\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7eb3\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7684Learning-to-Rank\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u504f\u89c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u533a\u5206\u7528\u6237\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops.

However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training.

Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks.

However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2).

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO.
