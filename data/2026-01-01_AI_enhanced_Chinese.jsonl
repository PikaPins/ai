Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDFT \u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u751f\u6210\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 DDFT \u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u751f\u6210\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "DDFT \u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6709\u5173\u3002\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "DDFT \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cluster and hybrid cloud deployments, maintaining consistent policy enforcement, predictable performance, and operational stability across heterogeneous gateway environments becomes challenging. Existing approaches typically manage security, governance, and performance as loosely coupled concerns, leading to configuration drift, delayed policy propagation, and unstable runtime behavior under dynamic workloads. This paper presents a governance-aware, intent-driven architecture for coordinated API gateway management in multi-cluster cloud environments. The proposed approach expresses security, governance, and performance objectives as high-level declarative intents, which are systematically translated into enforceable gateway configurations and continuously validated through policy verification and telemetry-driven feedback. By decoupling intent specification from enforcement while enabling bounded, policy-compliant adaptation, the architecture supports heterogeneous gateway implementations without compromising governance guarantees or service-level objectives. A prototype implementation across multiple Kubernetes clusters demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design. Experimental results show up to a 42% reduction in policy drift, a 31% improvement in configuration propagation time, and sustained p95 latency overhead below 6% under variable workloads, compared to manual and declarative baseline approaches.

Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF >= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL is stronger: across victims it achieves higher mean OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684DoS\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3002\u8fdb\u5316\u578b\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff08EOGen\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff08RL-GOAL\uff09\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u5047\u8bbe\u767d\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u76d2\u3001\u53ea\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff1a\u8fdb\u5316\u578b\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff08EOGen\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff08RL-GOAL\uff09\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u6291\u5236EOS\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u957f\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7f00\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cEOGen\u5728Phi-3\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u5b50\uff08OGF\uff09\u4e3a1.38 +/- 1.15\uff1b\u800cRL-GOAL\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe2.81 +/- 1.38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility.

We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement.

Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "RSA \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6\u5206\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u504f\u79bb\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4f46\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u7acb\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u504f\u79bb\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "RSA \u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0b\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "RSA \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5373\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4f46\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "RSA \u4e3a\u7ec6\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5371\u5bb3\u3002"}}

To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner.

A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success.

To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience.

However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c11\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9009\u53d6\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9886\u5934\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bGPT-4o-mini\u3001Gemini-2.0-Flash\u548cDeepSeek-V3\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5bc6\u82cf\u91cc\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u5b66\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u9898\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "DeepSeek-V3\u5728\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u5b66\u4e09\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e0a\u3002GPT-4o-mini\u548cGemini-2.0-Flash\u5927\u591a\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u522b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002DeepSeek-V3\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u8d77\uff0cGPT-4o-mini\u5219\u662f\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800cGemini\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u63d0\u524d\u4e0b\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u9898\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Since geometric operations are expensive in zero-knowledge proofs, privately performing the PiP test is challenging. In this paper, we answer the research questions of how different ways of encoding zones affect accuracy and proof cost by exploiting gridbased lookup tables under a fixed STARK execution model. Beyond a Boolean grid-based baseline that marks cells as in- or outside, we explore a distance-aware encoding approach that stores how far each cell is from a zone boundary and uses interpolation to reason within a cell. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed distance-aware approach achieves higher accuracy on coarse grids (max. 60%p accuracy gain) with only a moderate verification overhead (approximately 1.4x), making zone encoding the key lever for efficient zero-knowledge spatial checks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9aSTARK\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u70b9\u5728\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u5185\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08PiP\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5982\u4f55\u79c1\u5bc6\u5730\u6267\u884cPiP\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u8bc1\u660e\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8PiP\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff08\u6700\u591a60%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\uff08\u5927\u7ea61.4\u500d\u589e\u52a0\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u533a\u57df\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u9690\u79c1PiP\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eASCII\u7684\u827a\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.\n  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.\n  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9SourceRank\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u5305\u4f2a\u88c5\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5305\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSourceRank\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u826f\u6027\u5305\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5305\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5b83\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u53cd\u6620\u5305\u7684\u5220\u9664\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6258\u7ba1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u6076\u610f\u5305\u53ef\u80fd\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u53ef\u4fe1\u5305\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30SourceRank\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522bSourceRank\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u9879\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u89c4\u907f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5148\u8fdb\u4e14\u6743\u5a01\u7684MalwareBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u7684122,398\u4e2a\u5305\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5668\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u826f\u6027\u5305\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5305\u7684SourceRank\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\u826f\u6027\u5305\u4e0e\u6076\u610f\u5305\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u53e0\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531SourceRank\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u53cd\u6620\u5305\u7684\u5220\u9664\u60c5\u51b5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cURL\u6df7\u6dc6\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u5e38\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u89c4\u907f\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u5305\u7684SourceRank\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86SourceRank\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u826f\u6027\u5305\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5305\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86URL\u6df7\u6dc6\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants.

While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenZ \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002GenZ \u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528 EM \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "GenZ \u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u901a\u7528 EM \u7b97\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u672a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u89c6\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u6f5c\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "GenZ \u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u623f\u5c4b\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u591a\u65b9\u5217\u8868\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a12%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684GPT-5baseline\uff0838%\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u3002\u5728Netflix\u7535\u5f71\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u9884\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fbe\u52300.59\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u5927\u7ea6\u9700\u89814000\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GenZ \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynRAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08SOC\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u5982Palo Alto Networks Qradar\u3001Google SecOps\u3001Splunk\u3001Microsoft Sentinel\u548cElastic Stack\uff09\u4f7f\u5f97\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u76d1\u63a7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "SynRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5404\u4e2aSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u6bcf\u79cdSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30SynRAG\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT\u3001Llama\u3001DeepSeek\u3001Gemma\u548cClaude\uff09\uff0cSynRAG\u5728\u8de8SIEM\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "SynRAG\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540cSIEM\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ecROLL\u3001ROCK\u548ciFlow CLI\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002ALE\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u6392\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08IPA\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eALE\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u667a\u80fd\u4f53ROME\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u51fa\u8272\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE)\uff0c\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aRILL (Rollout Optimizer) \u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\uff1bROCK (Rollout Control Kit) \u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6c99\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b\u4ee5\u53caiFlow CLI\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7ALE\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3aROME\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u6392\u534f\u8bae\u548cIPA (Interaction-based Policy Alignment) \u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Terminal Bench Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eALE\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53ROME\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ALE\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In scenarios where each participant is responsible for its dataset, e.g., digital forensics, MP-PSI with threshold should disclose both intersection elements and corresponding holders such that elements are traceable and the reliability of intersection is guaranteed. We refer to MP-PSI with threshold supporting traceability as Traceable Over-Threshold MP-PSI (T-OT-MP-PSI). However, research on such protocols remains limited, and existing work tolerates at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants at considerable computational cost. We propose two novel Traceable OT-MP-PSI protocols. The first, Efficient Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ET-OT-MP-PSI), combines Shamir's secret sharing with an oblivious programmable pseudorandom function, achieving significantly improved efficiency with resistance to at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants. The second, Security-enhanced Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ST-OT-MP-PSI), achieves security against up to $n-1$ semi-honest participants by further leveraging the oblivious linear evaluation protocol. Compared to Mahdavi et al.'s protocol, ours eliminate the assumption that certain special parties do not collude. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: for $n=5$, $t=3$, and sets of size $2^{14}$, ET-OT-MP-PSI achieves $15056\\times$ speedup and ST-OT-MP-PSI achieves $505\\times$ speedup over Mahdavi et al.'s protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9608\u503c\u591a\u65b9\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\uff08MP-PSI\uff09\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5e26\u6709\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u7684\u9608\u503c\u591a\u65b9\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff08T-OT-MP-PSI\uff09\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u5e26\u6709\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u7684\u9608\u503c\u591a\u65b9\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff08ET-OT-MP-PSI\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Shamir\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e26\u6709\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u7684\u9608\u503c\u591a\u65b9\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff08ST-OT-MP-PSI\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u7ebf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "ET-OT-MP-PSI \u534f\u8bae\u5728 $n=5$\uff0c$t=3$\uff0c\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a $2^{14}$ \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d77Mahdavi\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 $15056$ \u500d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1bST-OT-MP-PSI \u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 $505$ \u500d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u578b\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u8bbe\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86 MPC-PSI \u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations.

By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u524d\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u5728\u5916\u73af\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u6570\u636eFine-tuning\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5916\u73af\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold. Extensive experiments show that RCS significantly improves robustness and utility while maintaining latency comparable to CS.
