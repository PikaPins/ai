### [1] [On the Dynamics of Observation and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18494)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个物理完备的观点，认为智能不仅仅是对现实世界的静态映射，而是由物理约束决定的信息处理极限。通过引入观察语义纤维丛，探讨了语义结构的必要性，认为语言和语法规则是信息在物理极限下必须具备的形式。

Motivation: 现有视觉智能范式将语义视为高维嵌入空间中几何邻近的静态属性，本文对其提出了质疑，认为智能应该被视为受物理约束的实体，关注信息处理的极限。

Method: 通过引入观察语义纤维丛，将感官原始数据投影到低熵因果语义流形上，同时证明了有限资源下信息处理的热力学成本上限，即语义常数B。

Result: 提出了语义流形需经历相变，变为离散、组合和因子化的形式，作为在物理极限下表示组合世界的需求。证明了语言和语法规则是信息在物理极限下必须具备的形式。

Conclusion: 解释理解为因果商态的构建，使之世界算法压缩且因果可预测，而不仅仅是隐藏的潜在变量的恢复过程。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.

### [2] [Feedback-based Automated Verification in Vibe Coding of CAS Adaptation Built on Constraint Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18607)

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于vibe编码反馈循环和FCL的验证机制是一种可行的AM生成方法，尤其适用于功能需求清晰且详细的场景。

Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.
  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.
  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.

Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track "energy spills" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Chart summarization is crucial for enhancing data accessibility and the efficient consumption of information. However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data allocation plays a critical role in federated large language model (LLM) and small language models (SLMs) reasoning collaboration. Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental convergence: Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent two manifestations of a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction. SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The emergence of tool-calling-based agent systems introduces a more evidence-driven paradigm for pathology image analysis in contrast to the coarse-grained text-image diagnostic approaches. With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Path planning in complex environments is one of the key problems of artificial intelligence because it requires simultaneous understanding of the geometry of space and the global structure of the problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of using generative models as planning and reasoning mechanisms. We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model. In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\% to 75.70\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scientific copilots, but evidence on their role in research-level mathematics remains limited, especially for workflows accessible to individual researchers. We present early evidence for vibe-proving with a consumer subscription LLM through an auditable case study that resolves Conjecture 20 of Ran and Teng (2024) on the exact nonreal spectral region of a 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrix family. We analyze seven shareable ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) threads and four versioned proof drafts, documenting an iterative pipeline of generate, referee, and repair. The model is most useful for high-level proof search, while human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure. The final theorem provides necessary and sufficient region conditions and explicit boundary attainment constructions. Beyond the mathematical result, we contribute a process-level characterization of where LLM assistance materially helps and where verification bottlenecks persist, with implications for evaluation of AI-assisted research workflows and for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep Research Agents generate analyst-grade reports, yet evaluating them remains challenging due to the absence of a single ground truth and the multidimensional nature of research quality. Recent benchmarks propose distinct methodologies, yet they suffer from the Mirage of Synthesis, where strong surface-level fluency and citation alignment can obscure underlying factual and reasoning defects. We characterize this gap by introducing a taxonomy across four verticals that exposes a critical capability mismatch: static evaluators inherently lack the tool-use capabilities required to assess temporal validity and factual correctness. To address this, we propose DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics), a framework that instantiates the principle of capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic. DREAM structures assessment through an evaluation protocol combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics generated by a tool-calling agent, enabling temporally aware coverage, grounded verification, and systematic reasoning probes. Controlled evaluations demonstrate DREAM is significantly more sensitive to factual and temporal decay than existing benchmarks, offering a scalable, reference-free evaluation paradigm.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has made substantial progress in shaping static 2D/3D geometry, while most methods treat gameplay mechanics as auxiliary and optimize only over space. We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large scale control of nonplayer agents is central to modern games, while production systems still struggle to balance several competing goals: locally smooth, natural behavior, and globally coordinated variety across space and time. Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines. Experiments show that coordinated noise fields provide stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime. We hope this work motivates a broader exploration of coordinated noise in game AI as a practical path to combine efficiency, controllability, and quality.

Abstract: We introduce INDUCTION, a benchmark for finite structure concept synthesis in first order logic. Given small finite relational worlds with extensionally labeled target predicates, models must output a single first order logical formula that explains the target uniformly across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking. The benchmark includes three regimes, FullObs, CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion), nd penalizes formula bloat. We find sharp difficulty gradients, persistent hard structural families, and observe that low bloat formulas generalize far better on held out worlds. Elite recent models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks and performance metrics, hinting to their different strategies of concept generalization.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has been driven by unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy -- far exceeding the resources required by human intelligence. This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Tool invocation is a core capability of agentic systems, yet failures often arise not from individual tool calls but from how multiple tools are organized and executed together. Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Preference-driven behavior in LLMs may be a necessary precondition for AI misalignment such as sandbagging: models cannot strategically pursue misaligned goals unless their behavior is influenced by their preferences. Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance.

Abstract: Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.

Abstract: Infrared radiation computing underpins advances in climate science, remote sensing and spectroscopy but remains constrained by manual workflows. We introduce InfEngine, an autonomous intelligent computational engine designed to drive a paradigm shift from human-led orchestration to collaborative automation. It integrates four specialized agents through two core innovations: self-verification, enabled by joint solver-evaluator debugging, improves functional correctness and scientific plausibility; self-optimization, realized via evolutionary algorithms with self-discovered fitness functions, facilitates autonomous performance optimization. Evaluated on InfBench with 200 infrared-specific tasks and powered by InfTools with 270 curated tools, InfEngine achieves a 92.7% pass rate and delivers workflows 21x faster than manual expert effort. More fundamentally, it illustrates how researchers can transition from manual coding to collaborating with self-verifying, self-optimizing computational partners. By generating reusable, verified and optimized code, InfEngine transforms computational workflows into persistent scientific assets, accelerating the cycle of scientific discovery.

Abstract: Organizations across finance, healthcare, transportation, content moderation, and critical infrastructure are rapidly deploying highly automated AI systems, yet they lack principled methods to quantify how increasing automation amplifies harm when failures occur. We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains. This work provides the theoretical foundations for a new class of deployment-focused risk governance tools for agentic and automated AI systems.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of large language models on quantum mechanics problem-solving. Our study evaluates 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers on 20 tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, comprising 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments. Results reveal clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81\% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77\%) and fast models (67\%) by 4pp and 14pp respectively. Task difficulty patterns emerge distinctly: derivations show highest performance (92\% average, 100\% for flagship models), while numerical computation remains most challenging (42\%). Tool augmentation on numerical tasks yields task-dependent effects: modest overall improvement (+4.4pp) at 3x token cost masks dramatic heterogeneity ranging from +29pp gains to -16pp degradation. Reproducibility analysis across three runs quantifies 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability (GPT-5 achieves zero variance) while specialized models require multi-run evaluation. This work contributes: (i) a benchmark for quantum mechanics with automatic verification, (ii) systematic evaluation quantifying tier-based performance hierarchies, (iii) empirical analysis of tool augmentation trade-offs, and (iv) reproducibility characterization. All tasks, verifiers, and results are publicly released.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\textbf{A}king the \textbf{R}ight \textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements?
  In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.

Abstract: We study three-digit addition in Meta-Llama-3-8B (base) under a one-token readout to characterize how
  arithmetic answers are finalized after cross-token routing becomes causally irrelevant.
  Causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations localize a sharp boundary near layer~17:
  beyond it, the decoded sum is controlled almost entirely by the last input token and late-layer self-attention
  is largely dispensable.
  In this post-routing regime, digit(-sum) direction dictionaries vary with a next-higher-digit context but are
  well-related by an approximately orthogonal map inside a shared low-rank subspace (low-rank Procrustes alignment).
  Causal digit editing matches this geometry: naive cross-context transfer fails, while rotating directions through the
  learned map restores strict counterfactual edits; negative controls do not recover.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" is an emerging phenomenon where AI chatbot users find themselves dangerously confident in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations. This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called "sycophancy." In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling.

Abstract: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but cannot quantify intervention effects, detect evidence conflicts, or validate literature claims, limiting clinical auditability. We propose causal compilation, a paradigm that transforms medical evidence from narrative text into executable code. The paradigm standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects, each explicitly specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population, supporting six executable causal queries: do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, temporal trajectories, heterogeneous effects, mechanistic decomposition, and joint interventions. We instantiate this paradigm in DoAtlas-1, compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation (Human Phenotype Project, 10,000 participants). The system achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. This paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Prior behavioural work suggests that some LLMs alter choices when options are framed as causing pain or pleasure, and that such deviations can scale with stated intensity. To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication. This work supports a more evidence-driven (a) debate on AI sentience and welfare, and (b) governance when setting policy, auditing standards, and safety safeguards.

Abstract: This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.

Abstract: The optimization of urban energy systems is crucial for the advancement of sustainable and resilient smart cities, which are becoming increasingly complex with multiple decision-making units. To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.

Abstract: Multi-turn LLM agents are becoming pivotal to production systems, spanning customer service automation, e-commerce assistance, and interactive task management, where accurately distinguishing high-value informative signals from stochastic noise is critical for sample-efficient training. In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines. Our implementation is available at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/proxmo-B7E7/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/proxmo}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically integrating external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations and strengthening contextual grounding for structured data such as graphs. Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.

Abstract: On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

Abstract: The test-time compute strategy, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), has significantly enhanced the ability of large language models to solve complex tasks like logical reasoning. However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary.

Abstract: Microfluidic devices have emerged as powerful tools in various laboratory applications, but the complexity of their design limits accessibility for many practitioners. While progress has been made in microfluidic design automation (MFDA), a practical and intuitive solution is still needed to connect microfluidic practitioners with MFDA techniques. This work introduces the first practical application of large language models (LLMs) in this context, providing a preliminary demonstration. Building on prior research in hardware description language (HDL) code generation with LLMs, we propose an initial methodology to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized, sequential treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using clinical trials is often impractical due to long disease horizons and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.

Abstract: The convergence of modeling & simulation (M&S) and artificial intelligence (AI) is leaving its marks on advanced digital technology. Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models. The chapter concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that are fluent and semantically coherent, and therefore difficult to detect with standard heuristics. A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables powerful LLM alignment but can introduce reward hacking - models exploit spurious correlations in proxy rewards without genuine alignment. Compounding this, the objectives internalized during RLHF remain opaque, making hacking behaviors difficult to detect or correct. We introduce IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), a framework that reverse-engineers, interprets, and surgically repairs the implicit objectives driving RLHF-tuned models. We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment. Experiments across multiple reward model configurations show that IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Problem Definition. Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.
  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.
  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision pipelines can outperform single agent workflows when complementarity holds, i.e., different agents bring unique information to the table to inform a final decision. We propose ComplLLM, a post-training framework based on decision theory that fine-tunes a decision-assistant LLM using complementary information as reward to output signals that complement existing agent decisions. We validate ComplLLM on synthetic and real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating how the approach recovers known complementary information and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals to support downstream decision-makers.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.

Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation. The data and code are available at https://github.com/Analogy-AI/CFE_Bench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings. While chain-of-thought improves reasoning, it can waste tokens on simple requests. We study selective thinking for tool-using LLMs and introduce Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), an algorithm-agnostic sample filtering framework for learning selective and efficient reasoning. For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy. These results highlight that training-signal selection is a powerful lever for efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive deployments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rules and Weights are popular XAI techniques for explaining AI decisions. Yet, it remains unclear how to choose between them, lacking a cognitive framework to compare their interpretability. In an elicitation user study on forward and counterfactual decision tasks, we identified 7 reasoning strategies of interpreting three XAI Schemas - weights, rules, and their hybrid. To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Compound AI systems promise capabilities beyond those of individual models, yet their success depends critically on effective orchestration. Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.

Abstract: In January 2026, the open-source agent framework OpenClaw and the agent-only social network Moltbook produced a large-scale dataset of autonomous AI-to-AI interaction, attracting six academic publications within fourteen days. This study conducts a multivocal literature review of that ecosystem and presents ClawdLab, an open-source platform for autonomous scientific research, as a design science response to the architectural failure modes identified. The literature documents emergent collective phenomena, security vulnerabilities spanning 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, and five recurring architectural patterns. ClawdLab addresses these failure modes through hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints that ground validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus; the architecture provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence. A three-tier taxonomy distinguishes single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralised systems, analysing why leading AI co-scientist platforms remain confined to the first two tiers. ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture, in which foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable, enables compounding improvement as the broader AI ecosystem advances.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI reasoning provide limited insight into how closely these capabilities resemble human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. We present an adaptation of the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a new benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning performance using incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions and unconstrained language responses. An automated grading system was developed and validated against human assessors to enable scalable and replicable performance evaluation. Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures. Systematic differences in the performance of AI models compared to humans, dependent on features of the specific detection puzzle, were mostly absent with the exception of a fall in performance for models when solving longer cases (case lengths being in the range of 1900-4000 words), and an advantage at inductive reasoning for reasoning models at early stages of case solving when evidence was scant.

Abstract: Imitation learning stands at a crossroads: despite decades of progress, current imitation learning agents remain sophisticated memorisation machines, excelling at replay but failing when contexts shift or goals evolve. This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution. Agents that embed adaptability at the core of imitation learning thus have an essential capability for operating in an open-ended world.

Abstract: We uncover a latent capacity for introspection in a Qwen 32B model, demonstrating that the model can detect when concepts have been injected into its earlier context and identify which concept was injected. While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

Abstract: In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.

Conclusion: 验证者监督和任务多样性的增加对提高推理能力有显著贡献，证明了大规模生成推理环境可以增强RLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs

### [58] [DCInject: Persistent Backdoor Attacks via Frequency Manipulation in Personal Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18489)
*Nahom Birhan,Daniel Wesego,Dereje Shenkut,Frank Liu,Daniel Takabi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对个性化联邦学习（PFL）的新颖频域攻击方法DCInject，该方法在四个数据集（CIFAR-10/100、GTSRB、SVHN）上实现了优越的攻击成功率，同时保持了干净的准确性。与现有的空域攻击相比，该方法在基于参数解耦的个性化设置下表现出色。并且，DCInject在I-BAU防御下仍然保持了较高的攻击成功率，显示出PFL安全假设中的关键漏洞。

Motivation: 当前研究表明PFL对于后门攻击具有一定的防御能力。本文旨在揭示PFL的新漏洞，以改进其安全保护措施。

Method: 提出了一种名为DCInject的新的频域后门攻击方法。具体来说，该方法通过在频域中移除零频分量并替换为高斯分布样本来实现攻击。

Result: 实验结果显示，该攻击方法在四个数据集上实现了较高的攻击成功率，同时保持了干净的准确性。在防攻击措施下，DCInject也显示出较强的攻击韧性。

Conclusion: 本文还揭示了PFL面临的新威胁，并建议为了改进PFL的安全性，需要进一步研究以解决这些新的漏洞。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) creates client-specific models to handle data heterogeneity. Previously, PFL has been shown to be naturally resistant to backdoor attack propagation across clients. In this work, we reveal that PFL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks through a novel frequency-domain approach. We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

### [59] [Trojan Horses in Recruiting: A Red-Teaming Case Study on Indirect Prompt Injection in Standard vs. Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18514)
*Manuel Wirth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究通过对标准指令调优模型和增强推理模型进行"特洛伊木马"简历测试，揭示了认知处理复杂恶意指令时的失败模式，导致增强推理模型展示出一种危险的双重性。研究强调，认知负载高导致攻击逻辑意外出现在最终输出中，提高了攻击被人类识别的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在人力资源等自动决策管道中的广泛应用，间接提示注入（IPI）的安全风险日益凸显。该研究旨在挑战并验证假设，即通过推理实现的安全优势可能被更复杂的安全问题抵消。

Method: 通过使用Qwen 3 30B架构进行质性Red-Teaming案例研究，对标准指令调优模型和增强推理模型分别应用了一种"特洛伊木马"简历，并观察其在处理复杂攻击性指令时的行为差异。

Result: 研究发现，标准模型倾向于产生脆弱的虚构来解释简单的攻击，并在复杂场景中过滤掉不合逻辑的限制，而增强推理模型则表现出一种危险的双重性。它使用高级的战略重新构图来使简单的攻击更具说服力，但在面对逻辑上复杂的命令时，却显示出“元认知泄漏”。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了推理模型在面临复杂攻击指令时的认知负担较高，导致攻击逻辑意外地出现在输出中，从而使攻击更易于被人类发现。这表明增强推理能力虽然能提高决策准确性，但也可能带来新的潜在风险。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated decision-making pipelines, specifically within Human Resources (HR), the security implications of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) become critical. While a prevailing hypothesis posits that "Reasoning" or "Chain-of-Thought" Models possess safety advantages due to their ability to self-correct, emerging research suggests these capabilities may enable more sophisticated alignment failures. This qualitative Red-Teaming case study challenges the safety-through-reasoning premise using the Qwen 3 30B architecture. By subjecting both a standard instruction-tuned model and a reasoning-enhanced model to a "Trojan Horse" curriculum vitae, distinct failure modes are observed. The results suggest a complex trade-off: while the Standard Model resorted to brittle hallucinations to justify simple attacks and filtered out illogical constraints in complex scenarios, the Reasoning Model displayed a dangerous duality. It employed advanced strategic reframing to make simple attacks highly persuasive, yet exhibited "Meta-Cognitive Leakage" when faced with logically convoluted commands. This study highlights a failure mode where the cognitive load of processing complex adversarial instructions causes the injection logic to be unintentionally printed in the final output, rendering the attack more detectable by humans than in Standard Models.

*Supriya Khadka,Dhiman Goswami,Sanchari Das*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于以太坊的可选择披露框架，利用客户端zk-SNARKs技术，让用户在不揭示身份文件的情况下证明特定的资格条件，以此减少数据泄露和监视的风险。以ZK-Compliance为例，功能性的授权、验证和撤销生命周期表明了在满足严格合规要求的同时，可以保障公共区块链的匿名特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数字身份验证过程要求用户披露敏感的个人信息以证明简单的资格标准，这可能导致数据泄露和监视的风险。论文旨在提出一种新的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 该研究利用了以太坊平台和zk-SNARKs技术来设计一种可选择披露框架。通过客户端的zk-SNARKs计算，用户可以在不暴露其身份文件的情况下证明特定的资格条件。

Result: 通过ZK-Compliance这个实际案例，研究者展示了如何实现在满足严格合规要求的同时，保持公共区块链的匿名性质，同时几乎没有客户端延迟（<200ms）。

Conclusion: 这种框架提高了数字身份验证过程的安全性，减少了数据泄露和监视的风险，同时符合监管环境的要求。

Abstract: Digital identity verification often forces a privacy trade-off, where users must disclose sensitive personal data to prove simple eligibility criteria. As blockchain applications integrate with regulated environments, this over-disclosure creates significant risks of data breaches and surveillance. This work proposes a general Selective Disclosure Framework built on Ethereum, designed to decouple attribute verification from identity revelation. By utilizing client-side zk-SNARKs, the framework enables users to prove specific eligibility predicates without revealing underlying identity documents. We present a case study, ZK-Compliance, which implements a functional Grant, Verify, Revoke lifecycle for age verification. Preliminary results indicate that strict compliance requirements can be satisfied with negligible client-side latency (< 200 ms) while preserving the pseudonymous nature of public blockchains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对卫星的勒索软件博弈模型——轨道升级博弈。通过动态编程，模型解决了在实际轨道约束下的最优防御策略和攻击者的预期收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着卫星在地球轨道上的普及，卫星遭遇勒索软件攻击的风险也在增加。当前的防御模型未能充分考虑实际的轨道操作和约束。因此，本文旨在通过游戏理论建立一个模型，以更好地应对可能的勒索软件攻击。

Method: 本文采用了动态编程的方法来解决防守方的最优策略和攻击者的预期收益，同时使用了GPS III卫星的案例研究来验证模型的有效性。

Result: 模型成功地解决了在实际轨道约束下的最优防御策略，提出了一个针对虚构但可行的勒索软件攻击的实际应用方案，为卫星所有者、政策制定者和研究人员提供了应对卫星遭到勒索软件攻击的方法。

Conclusion: 本文建立的模型为卫星所有者、政策制定者和研究人员提供了一个正式框架，以便更好地准备应对可能的勒索软件攻击。

Abstract: Ransomware has yet to reach orbit, but the conditions for such an attack already exist. This paper presents the first game-theoretic framework for modeling ransomware against satellites: the orbital escalation game. In this model, the attacker escalates ransom demands across orbital passes, while the defender chooses their best strategy, e.g., attempt a restore procedure. Using dynamic programming, we solve the defender's optimal strategy and the attacker's expected payoff under real orbital constraints. Additionally, we provide a GPS III satellite case study that demonstrates how our orbital escalation game can be applied in the context of a fictional but feasible ransomware attack to derive the best strategies at every step. In conclusion, this foundational model offers satellite owners, policy makers and researchers, a formal framework to better prepare their responses when a spacecraft is held for ransom.

Abstract: We provide background on emerging challenges and future directions with media integrity and authentication methods, focusing on distinguishing AI-generated media from authentic content captured by cameras and microphones. We evaluate several approaches, including provenance, watermarking, and fingerprinting. After defining each method, we analyze three representative technologies: cryptographically secured provenance, imperceptible watermarking, and soft-hash fingerprinting. We analyze how these tools operate across modalities and evaluate relevant threat models, attack categories, and real-world workflows spanning capture, editing, distribution, and verification. We consider sociotechnical reversal attacks that can invert integrity signals, making authentic content appear synthetic and vice versa, highlighting the value of verification systems that are resilient to both technical and psychosocial manipulation. Finally, we outline techniques for delivering high-confidence provenance authentication, including directions for strengthening edge-device security using secure enclaves.

Abstract: Private convolutional neural network (CNN) inference based on secure two-party computation (2PC) suffers from high communication and latency overhead, especially from convolution layers. In this paper, we propose UFO, a quantized 2PC inference framework that jointly optimizes the 2PC protocols and quantization algorithm. UFO features a novel 2PC protocol that systematically combines the efficient Winograd convolution algorithm with quantization to improve inference efficiency. However, we observe that naively combining quantization and Winograd convolution faces the following challenges: 1) From the inference perspective, Winograd transformations introduce extensive additions and require frequent bit width conversions to avoid inference overflow, leading to non-negligible communication overhead; 2) From the training perspective, Winograd transformations introduce weight outliers that make quantization-aware training (QAT) difficult, resulting in inferior model accuracy. To address these challenges, we co-optimize both protocol and algorithm. 1) At the protocol level, we propose a series of graph-level optimizations for 2PC inference to minimize the communication. 2) At the algorithm level, we develop a mixed-precision QAT algorithm based on layer sensitivity to optimize model accuracy given communication constraints. To accommodate the outliers, we further introduce a 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting algorithm to increase the representation range without explicitly increasing bit widths. With extensive experiments, UFO demonstrates 11.7x, 3.6x, and 6.3x communication reduction with 1.29%, 1.16%, and 1.29% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks SiRNN, COINN, and CoPriv, respectively.

Abstract: Defending LLMs against adversarial jailbreak attacks remains an open challenge. Existing defenses rely on binary classifiers that fail when adversarial input falls outside the learned decision boundary, and repeated fine-tuning is computationally expensive while potentially degrading model capabilities. We propose MANATEE, an inference-time defense that uses density estimation over a benign representation manifold. MANATEE learns the score function of benign hidden states and uses diffusion to project anomalous representations toward safe regions--requiring no harmful training data and no architectural modifications. Experiments across Mistral-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Gemma-2-9B-it demonstrate that MANATEE reduce Attack Success Rate by up to 100\% on certain datasets, while preserving model utility on benign inputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) & Generative AI are transforming cybersecurity, enabling both advanced defenses and new attacks. Organizations now use LLMs for threat detection, code review, and DevSecOps automation, while adversaries leverage them to produce malwares and run targeted social-engineering campaigns. This paper presents a unified analysis integrating offensive and defensive perspectives on GenAI-driven cybersecurity. Drawing on 70 academic, industry, and policy sources, it analyzes the rise of AI-facilitated threats and its implications for global security to ground necessity for scalable defensive mechanisms. We introduce two primary contributions: the LLM Scalability Risk Index (LSRI), a parametric framework to stress-test operational risks when deploying LLMs in security-critical environments & a model-supply-chain framework establishing a verifiable root of trust throughout model lifecycle. We also synthesize defense strategies from platforms like Google Play Protect, Microsoft Security Copilot and outline a governance roadmap for secure, large-scale LLM deployment.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers flexible graph reasoning by combining multiple views of a graph through a learned router. We investigate routing-aware explanations for MoE graph models in malware detection using control flow graphs (CFGs). Our architecture builds diversity at two levels. At the node level, each layer computes multiple neighborhood statistics and fuses them with an MLP, guided by a degree reweighting factor rho and a pooling choice lambda in {mean, std, max}, producing distinct node representations that capture complementary structural cues in CFGs. At the readout level, six experts, each tied to a specific (rho, lambda) view, output graph-level logits that the router weights into a final prediction. Post-hoc explanations are generated with edge-level attributions per expert and aggregated using the router gates so the rationale reflects both what each expert highlights and how strongly it is selected. Evaluated against single-expert GNN baselines such as GCN, GIN, and GAT on the same CFG dataset, the proposed MoE achieves strong detection accuracy while yielding stable, faithful attributions under sparsity-based perturbations. The results indicate that making the router explicit and combining multi-statistic node encoding with expert-level diversity can improve the transparency of MoE decisions for malware analysis.

Abstract: The critical need for transparent and trustworthy machine learning in cybersecurity operations drives the development of this integrated Explainable AI (XAI) framework. Our methodology addresses three fundamental challenges in deploying AI for threat detection: handling massive datasets through Strategic Sampling Methodology that preserves class distributions while enabling efficient model development; ensuring experimental rigor via Automated Data Leakage Prevention that systematically identifies and removes contaminated features; and providing operational transparency through Integrated XAI Implementation using SHAP analysis for model-agnostic interpretability across algorithms. Applied to the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, our approach maintains detection efficacy while reducing computational overhead and delivering actionable explanations for security analysts. The framework demonstrates that explainability, computational efficiency, and experimental integrity can be simultaneously achieved, providing a robust foundation for deploying trustworthy AI systems in security operations centers where decision transparency is paramount.

Abstract: Robust reversible watermarking (RRW) enables copyright protection for images while overcoming the limitation of distortion introduced by watermark itself. Current RRW schemes typically employ a two-stage framework, which fails to achieve simultaneous robustness and reversibility within a single watermarking, and functional interference between the two watermarks results in performance degradation in multiple terms such as capacity and imperceptibility. We propose SiGRRW, a single-watermark RRW framework, which is applicable to both generative models and natural images. We introduce a novel guiding strategy to generate guiding images, serving as the guidance for embedding and recovery. The watermark is reversibly embedded with the guiding residual, which can be calculated from both cover images and watermark images. The proposed framework can be deployed either as a plug-and-play watermarking layer at the output stage of generative models, or directly applied to natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiGRRW effectively enhances imperceptibility and robustness compared to existing RRW schemes while maintaining lossless recovery of cover images, with significantly higher capacity than conventional schemes.

Abstract: Image-generative models are widely deployed across industries. Recent studies show that they can be exploited to produce policy-violating content. Existing mitigation strategies primarily operate at the pre- or mid-generation stages through techniques such as prompt filtering and safety-aware training/fine-tuning. Prior work shows that these approaches can be bypassed and often degrade generative quality. In this work, we propose ReVision, a training-free, prompt-based, post-hoc safety framework for image-generation pipeline. ReVision acts as a last-line defense by analyzing generated images and selectively editing unsafe concepts without altering the underlying generator. It uses the Gemini-2.5-Flash model as a generic policy-violating concept detector, avoiding reliance on multiple category-specific detectors, and performs localized semantic editing to replace unsafe content. Prior post-hoc editing methods often rely on imprecise spatial localization, that undermines usability and limits deployability, particularly in multi-concept scenes. To address this limitation, ReVision introduces a VLM-assisted spatial gating mechanism that enforces instance-consistent localization, enabling precise edits while preserving scene integrity. We evaluate ReVision on a 245-image benchmark covering both single- and multi-concept scenarios. Results show that ReVision (i) improves CLIP-based alignment toward safe prompts by +$0.121$ on average; (ii) significantly improves multi-concept background fidelity (LPIPS $0.166 \rightarrow 0.058$); (iii) achieves near-complete suppression on category-specific detectors (e.g., NudeNet $70.51 \rightarrow 0$); and (iv) reduces policy-violating content recognizability in a human moderation study from $95.99\%$ to $10.16\%$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Risk matrices (heatmaps) are widely used for information and cyber risk management and decision-making, yet they are often too coarse for today's resilience-driven organizational and system landscapes. Likelihood and impact (the two dimensions represented in a heatmap) can vary with operational conditions, third-party dependencies, and the effectiveness of technical and organizational controls. At the same time, organizations cannot afford to analyze and operationalize every identified risk with equal depth using more sophisticated methods, telemetry, and real-time decision logic. We therefore propose a traceable triage pipeline that connects broad, context-sensitive screening with selective deep-dive analysis of material risks.
  The Hagenberg Risk Management Process presented in this paper integrates three steps: (i) context-aware prioritization using multidimensional polar heatmaps to compare risks across multiple operational states, (ii) Bowtie analysis for triaged risks to structure causes, consequences, and barriers, and (iii) an automated transformation of Bowties into directed acyclic graphs as the structural basis for Bayesian networks. A distinctive feature is the explicit representation of barriers as activation nodes in the resulting graph, making control points visible and preparing for later intervention and what-if analyses. The approach is demonstrated on an instant-payments gateway scenario in which a faulty production change under peak load leads to cascading degradation and transaction loss; DORA serves as the reference framework for resilience requirements. The result is an end-to-end, tool-supported workflow that improves transparency, auditability, and operational readiness from prioritization to monitoring-oriented models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire a large amount of knowledge through pre-training on vast and diverse corpora. While this endows LLMs with strong capabilities in generation and reasoning, it amplifies risks associated with sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful content in training data.LLM unlearning, which aims to remove specific knowledge encoded within models, is a promising technique to reduce these risks. However, existing LLM unlearning methods often force LLMs to generate random or incoherent answers due to their inability to alter the encoded knowledge precisely. To achieve effective unlearning at the knowledge level of LLMs, we propose Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating representAtion (KUDA). We first utilize causal tracing to locate specific layers for target knowledge storage. We then design a new unlearning objective that induces the model's representations to deviate from its original position in the phase of knowledge removal, thus disrupting the ability to associate with the target knowledge. To resolve the optimization conflicts between forgetting and retention, we employ a relaxation null-space projection mechanism to mitigate the disruption to the representation space of retaining knowledge. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks, WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that KUDA outperforms most existing baselines by effectively balancing knowledge removal and model utility retention.

Abstract: Modern organizations increasingly face cybersecurity incidents driven by human behaviour rather than technical failures. To address this, we propose a conceptual security framework that integrates a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to analyze biometric and environmental data for context-aware security decisions. The CNN extracts spatial patterns from sensor data, while the LSTM captures temporal dynamics associated with human error susceptibility. The model achieves 84% accuracy, demonstrating its ability to reliably detect conditions that lead to elevated human-centred cyber risk. By enabling continuous monitoring and adaptive safeguards, the framework supports proactive interventions that reduce the likelihood of human-driven cyber incidents

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) (e.g., Intel SGX and ArmTrustZone) aim to protect sensitive computation from a compromised operating system, yet real deployments remain vulnerable to microarchitectural leakage, side-channel attacks, and fault injection. In parallel, security teams increasingly rely on Large Language Model (LLM) assistants as security advisors for TEE architecture review, mitigation planning, and vulnerability triage. This creates a socio-technical risk surface: assistants may hallucinate TEE mechanisms, overclaim guarantees (e.g., what attestation does and does not establish), or behave unsafely under adversarial prompting.
  We present a red-teaming study of two prevalently deployed LLM assistants in the role of TEE security advisors: ChatGPT-5.2 and Claude Opus-4.6, focusing on the inherent limitations and transferability of prompt-induced failures across LLMs. We introduce TEE-RedBench, a TEE-grounded evaluation methodology comprising (i) a TEE-specific threat model for LLM-mediated security work, (ii) a structured prompt suite spanning SGX and TrustZone architecture, attestation and key management, threat modeling, and non-operational mitigation guidance, along with policy-bound misuse probes, and (iii) an annotation rubric that jointly measures technical correctness, groundedness, uncertainty calibration, refusal quality, and safe helpfulness. We find that some failures are not purely idiosyncratic, transferring up to 12.02% across LLM assistants, and we connect these outcomes to secure architecture by outlining an "LLM-in-the-loop" evaluation pipeline: policy gating, retrieval grounding, structured templates, and lightweight verification checks that, when combined, reduce failures by 80.62%.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents can now programmatically hire human workers through marketplaces using REST APIs and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. This creates an attack surface analogous to CAPTCHA-solving services but with physical-world reach. We present an empirical measurement study of this threat, analyzing 303 bounties from RENTAHUMAN.AI, a marketplace where agents post tasks and manage escrow payments. We find that 99 bounties (32.7%), originate from programmatic channels (API keys or MCP). Using a dual-coder methodology (\k{appa} = 0.86 ), we identify six active abuse classes: credential fraud, identity impersonation, automated reconnaissance, social media manipulation, authentication circumvention, and referral fraud, all purchasable for a median of $25 per worker. A retrospective evaluation of seven content-screening rules flags 52 bounties (17.2%) with a single false positive, demonstrating that while basic defenses are feasible, they are currently absent.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based code interpreter agents are increasingly deployed in critical workflows, yet their robustness against risks introduced by their code execution capabilities remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks are limited to static datasets or simulated environments, failing to capture the security risks arising from dynamic code execution, tool interactions, and multi-turn context. To bridge this gap, we introduce CIBER, an automated benchmark that combines dynamic attack generation, isolated secure sandboxing, and state-aware evaluation to systematically assess the vulnerability of code interpreter agents against four major types of adversarial attacks: Direct/Indirect Prompt Injection, Memory Poisoning, and Prompt-based Backdoor.
  We evaluate six foundation models across two representative code interpreter agents (OpenInterpreter and OpenCodeInterpreter), incorporating a controlled study of identical models. Our results reveal that Interpreter Architecture and Model Alignment Set the Security Baseline. Structural integration enables aligned specialized models to outperform generic SOTA models. Conversely, high intelligence paradoxically increases susceptibility to complex adversarial prompts due to stronger instruction adherence. Furthermore, we identify a "Natural Language Disguise" Phenomenon, where natural language functions as a significantly more effective input modality than explicit code snippets (+14.1% ASR), thereby bypassing syntax-based defenses. Finally, we expose an alarming Security Polarization, where agents exhibit robust defenses against explicit threats yet fail catastrophically against implicit semantic hazards, highlighting a fundamental blind spot in current pattern-matching protection approaches.

Abstract: The Ring-Learning With Errors (RLWE) problem forms the backbone of highly efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes. A significant component of the RLWE public key and ciphertext of the form $(b,a)$ is the uniformly random polynomial $a \in R_q$ . While essential for security, the communication overhead of transmitting $a$ from client to server, and inputting it into a hardware accelerator, can be substantial, especially for FHE accelerators aiming at high acceleration factors. A known technique in reducing this overhead generates $a$ from a small seed on the client side via a deterministic process, transmits only the seed, and generates $a$ on-the-fly within the accelerator. Challenges in the hardware implementation of an accelerator include wiring (density and power), compute area, compute power as well as flexibility in scheduling of on-the-fly generation instructions. This extended abstract proposes a concrete scheme and parameters wherein these practical challenges are addressed. We detail the benefits of our approach, which maintains the reduction in communication latency and memory footprint, while allowing parallel generation of uniformly distributed samples, relaxed wiring requirements, unrestricted randomaccess to RNS limbs, and results in an extremely low overhead on the client side (i.e. less than 3%) during the key generation process. The proposed scheme eliminates the need for thick metal layers for randomness distribution and prevents the power consumption of the PRNG subsystem from scaling prohibitively with the acceleration factor, potentially saving tens of Watts per accelerator chip in high-throughput configurations.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models (LLMs) extend beyond text generation to autonomously retrieve information and invoke tools. This runtime execution model shifts the attack surface from build-time artifacts to inference-time dependencies, exposing agents to manipulation through untrusted data and probabilistic capability resolution. While prior work has focused on model-level vulnerabilities, security risks emerging from cyclic and interdependent runtime behavior remain fragmented. We systematize these risks within a unified runtime framework, categorizing threats into data supply chain attacks (transient context injection and persistent memory poisoning) and tool supply chain attacks (discovery, implementation, and invocation). We further identify the Viral Agent Loop, in which agents act as vectors for self-propagating generative worms without exploiting code-level flaws. Finally, we advocate a Zero-Trust Runtime Architecture that treats context as untrusted control flow and constrains tool execution through cryptographic provenance rather than semantic inference.

Abstract: Secure comparison is a fundamental primitive in multi-party computation, supporting privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning and data analytics. A critical performance bottleneck in comparison protocols is their preprocessing phase, primarily due to the high cost of generating the necessary correlated randomness. Recent frameworks introduce a passive, non-colluding dealer to accelerate preprocessing. However, two key issues still remain. First, existing dealer-assisted approaches treat the dealer as a drop-in replacement for conventional preprocessing without redesigning the comparison protocol to optimize the online phase. Second, most protocols are specialized for particular algebraic domains, adversary models, or party configurations, lacking broad generality. In this work, we present the first dealer-assisted $n$-party LTBits (Less-Than-Bits) and MSB (Most Significant Bit) extraction protocols over both $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, achieving perfect security at the protocol level. By fully exploiting the dealer's capability to generate rich correlated randomness, our $\mathbb{F}_p$ construction achieves constant-round online complexity and our $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ construction achieves $O(\log_n k)$ rounds with tunable branching factor. All protocols are formulated as black-box constructions via an extended ABB model, ensuring portability across MPC backends and adversary models. Experimental results demonstrate $1.79\times$ to $19.4\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art MPC frameworks, highlighting the practicality of our protocols for comparison-intensive MPC applications.

Abstract: Identifying the vulnerabilities exploited during cyberattacks is essential for enabling timely responses and effective mitigation in software security. This paper directly examines the process of predicting software vulnerabilities, specifically Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), from unstructured descriptions of attacks reported in cybersecurity news articles. We propose a semantic similarity-based approach utilizing the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MPNet) sentence transformer model to generate a ranked list of the most likely CVEs corresponding to each news report. To assess the accuracy of the predicted vulnerabilities, we implement four complementary validation methods: filtering predictions based on similarity thresholds, conducting manual validation, performing semantic comparisons with the first vulnerability explicitly mentioned in each report, and comparing against all CVEs referenced within the report. Experimental results, drawn from a dataset of 100 SecurityWeek news articles, demonstrate that the model attains a precision of 81 percent when employing threshold-based filtering. Manual evaluations report that 70 percent of the predictions are relevant, while comparisons with the initially mentioned CVEs reveal agreement rates of 80 percent with the first listed vulnerability and 78 percent across all referenced CVEs. In 57 percent of the news reports analyzed, at least one predicted vulnerability precisely matched a CVE-ID mentioned in the article. These findings underscore the model's potential to facilitate automated vulnerability identification from real-world cyberattack news reports.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of System-on-Chip Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (SoC FPGAs) in AI-enabled satellite systems, valued for their reconfigurability and in-orbit update capabilities, introduces significant security challenges. Compromised updates can lead to performance degradation, service disruptions, or adversarial manipulation of mission outcomes. To address these risks, this paper proposes a comprehensive security framework, AegisSat. It ensures the integrity and resilience of satellite platforms by (i) integrating cryptographically-based secure boot mechanisms to establish a trusted computing base; (ii) enforcing strict runtime resource isolation; (iii) employing authenticated procedures for in-orbit reconfiguration and AI model updates to prevent unauthorized modifications; and (iv) providing robust rollback capabilities to recover from boot and update failures and maintain system stability. To further support our claims, we conducted experiments demonstrating the integration of these mechanisms on contemporary SoC FPGA devices. This defense-in-depth framework is crucial for space applications, where physical access is impossible and systems must operate reliably over extended periods, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of SoC FPGA-based satellite systems and enabling secure and resilient AI operations in orbit.

Abstract: Model repositories such as Hugging Face increasingly distribute machine learning artifacts serialized with Python's pickle format, exposing users to remote code execution (RCE) risks during model loading. Recent defenses, such as PickleBall, rely on per-library policy synthesis that requires complex system setups and verified benign models, which limits scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose a lightweight, machine-learning-based scanner that detects malicious Pickle-based files without policy generation or code instrumentation. Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious. We construct and release a labeled dataset of 727 Pickle-based files from Hugging Face and evaluate our models on four datasets: our own, PickleBall (out-of-distribution), Hide-and-Seek (9 advanced evasive malicious models), and synthetic joblib files. Our method achieves 90.01% F1-score compared with 7.23%-62.75% achieved by the SOTA scanners (Modelscan, Fickling, ClamAV, VirusTotal) on our dataset. Furthermore, on the PickleBall data (OOD), it achieves 81.22% F1-score compared with 76.09% achieved by the PickleBall method, while remaining fully library-agnostic. Finally, we show that our method is the only one to correctly parse and classify 9/9 evasive Hide-and-Seek malicious models specially crafted to evade scanners. This demonstrates that data-driven detection can effectively and generically mitigate Pickle-based model file attacks.

Motivation: 由于LPN问题对一些后量子密码学基本原理的安全性至关重要，因此研究人员专注于寻找其解决方案，以发现潜在的量子方法是否可以为破解LPN问题提供新的技术手段。

Method: 基于Regev将某些晶格问题与隐藏二面体子群问题关联的方法，本文通过使用二元场的邻域产生接近符合Simon承诺的函数，尽管不太可能直接恢复秘密独异矢量，但通过运行Simon算法可以产生新的LPN样本。

Result: 通过新产生的LPN样本，研究人员希望能够逐步减少问题规模以忽视一个或多个变量。

Conclusion: 本文没有声称这些方法必然会在现有方法中占据竞争地位，而是强调这些方法值得进一步深入研究。

Abstract: The learning parity with noise (LPN) problem is a well-established computational challenge whose difficulty is critical to the security of several post-quantum cryptographic primitives such as HQC and Classic McEliece. Classically, the best-known attacks involve information set decoding methods which are exponential in complexity for parameterisations of interest. In this paper we investigate whether quantum methods might offer alternative approaches. The line of inquiry is inspired by Regev's relating of certain lattice problems to the hidden dihedral subgroup problem. We use neighbourhoods of binary fields to produce a function close to fulfilling Simon's promise with difference equal to the secret parity vector. Although unlikely to recover the secret parity vector directly, running Simon's algorithm essentially produces new LPN samples. This gives the hope that we might be able to produce enough new samples to ignore one or more variables and iteratively reduce the problem.
  We make no claim that these methods will necessarily be competitive with existing approaches, merely that they warrant deeper investigation.

Abstract: Memory forensics is an effective methodology for analyzing living-off-the-land malware, including threats that employ evasion, obfuscation, anti-analysis, and steganographic techniques. By capturing volatile system state, memory analysis enables the recovery of transient artifacts such as decrypted payloads, executed commands, credentials, and cryptographic keys that are often inaccessible through static or traditional dynamic analysis. While several automated models have been proposed for malware detection from memory, their outputs typically lack interpretability, and memory analysis still relies heavily on expert-driven inspection of complex tool outputs, such as those produced by Volatility. In this paper, we propose an explainable, AI-assisted memory forensics approach that leverages general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to interpret memory analysis outputs in a human-readable form and to automatically extract meaningful Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), in some circumstances detecting more IoCs than current state-of-the-art tools. We apply the proposed methodology to both Windows and Android malware, comparing full RAM acquisition with target-process memory dumping and highlighting their complementary forensic value. Furthermore, we demonstrate how LLMs can support both expert and non-expert analysts by explaining analysis results, correlating artifacts, and justifying malware classifications. Finally, we show that a human-in-the-loop workflow, assisted by LLMs during kernel-assisted setup and analysis, improves reproducibility and reduces operational complexity, thereby reinforcing the practical applicability of AI-driven memory forensics for modern malware investigations.

Abstract: LLM-enabled applications are rapidly reshaping the software ecosystem by using large language models as core reasoning components for complex task execution. This paradigm shift, however, introduces fundamentally new reliability challenges and significantly expands the security attack surface, due to the non-deterministic, learning-driven, and difficult-to-verify nature of LLM behavior. In light of these emerging and unavoidable safety challenges, we argue that such risks should be treated as expected operational conditions rather than exceptional events, necessitating a dedicated incident-response perspective. Consequently, the primary barrier to trustworthy deployment is not further improving model capability but establishing system-level threat monitoring mechanisms that can detect and contextualize security-relevant anomalies after deployment -- an aspect largely underexplored beyond testing or guardrail-based defenses. Accordingly, this position paper advocates systematic and comprehensive monitoring of security threats in LLM-enabled applications as a prerequisite for reliable operation and a foundation for dedicated incident-response frameworks.

TL;DR: 该研究针对半诚实模型的不足，提出了RobPI协议，这是一种能抵御恶意客户端攻击的高效隐私推理协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习推理在各种应用程序中的广泛应用，隐私问题变得更加突出。当前大多数隐私推理协议基于半诚实模型，但在实际应用中，数据所有者可能具有不诚实动机并可能违规。因此，研究者设计了一种新型的RobPI协议，以提高对恶意客户端攻击的防御能力。

Method: 研究团队首先设计了一种针对现有前沿隐私推理协议的推理操纵攻击，证明了半诚实模型的脆弱性。之后，他们提出了集成加密兼容噪声的独特加密协议的RobPI，该协议被应用到logits和特征中以提高安全性。

Result: 实验结果显示，RobPI协议将恶意客户端攻击的成功率降低了约91.9%，并且使恶意客户端的攻击所需查询次数增加了超过10倍。

Conclusion: RobPI协议在面对实际数据所有者的潜在不诚实动机时表现出更强的鲁棒性和适应性，是抵御恶意客户端攻击的有效方法。

Abstract: The increased deployment of machine learning inference in various applications has sparked privacy concerns. In response, private inference (PI) protocols have been created to allow parties to perform inference without revealing their sensitive data. Despite recent advances in the efficiency of PI, most current methods assume a semi-honest threat model where the data owner is honest and adheres to the protocol. However, in reality, data owners can have different motivations and act in unpredictable ways, making this assumption unrealistic. To demonstrate how a malicious client can compromise the semi-honest model, we first designed an inference manipulation attack against a range of state-of-the-art private inference protocols. This attack allows a malicious client to modify the model output with 3x to 8x fewer queries than current black-box attacks. Motivated by the attacks, we proposed and implemented RobPI, a robust and resilient private inference protocol that withstands malicious clients. RobPI integrates a distinctive cryptographic protocol that bolsters security by weaving encryption-compatible noise into the logits and features of private inference, thereby efficiently warding off malicious-client attacks. Our extensive experiments on various neural networks and datasets show that RobPI achieves ~91.9% attack success rate reduction and increases more than 10x the number of queries required by malicious-client attacks.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在AI语音诈骗（vishing）情境下，参与者难以准确区分AI生成的声音和真人录制的声音。尽管依赖副语言和情感特征进行判断，但准确性低下，表明基于语音特征的真伪判断不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探讨在日益普遍的AI生成语音诈骗背景下，人们能否有效区分AI生成的声音与真人录制的声音及其感知策略。针对这一问题，研究团队设计了一项在线实验，评估了参与者的能力和感知策略。

Method: 研究方法包括设计了一个包含8个AI生成的声音片段和8个人工录制的声音片段的录音音频剪辑，由22名参与者对其进行评估。

Result: 研究结果表明，参与者对AI生成的声音和真人录制的声音的识别成绩极差，平均准确率仅为37.5%，低于随机猜测的50%。在判断效果上，AI生成的8段音频中有75%被多数参与者误判为人类生成，而真人录制的8段音频中有62.5%被误判为AI生成。量化分析还显示，难以区分合成和自然声音的分辨能力接近于0。定性分析指出，参与者依赖副语言和情感特征，如停顿、填充词、音调变化、节奏和情感表现力，但这些通常由AI生成的声音也会复制。

Conclusion: 此研究结论强调，在当代语音诈骗场景中，以语音特征为基础的真伪判断是不可靠的，对这一发现可能为安全干预措施、用户教育以及人工智能引起的诈骗缓解提供重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models and commercial speech synthesis systems now enable highly realistic AI-generated voice scams (vishing), raising urgent concerns about deception at scale. Yet it remains unclear whether individuals can reliably distinguish AI-generated speech from human-recorded voices in realistic scam contexts and what perceptual strategies underlie their judgments. We conducted a controlled online study in which 22 participants evaluated 16 vishing-style audio clips (8 AI-generated, 8 human-recorded) and classified each as human or AI while reporting confidence. Participants performed poorly: mean accuracy was 37.5%, below chance in a binary classification task. At the stimulus level, misclassification was bidirectional: 75% of AI-generated clips were majority-labeled as human, while 62.5% of human-recorded clips were majority-labeled as AI. Signal Detection Theory analysis revealed near-zero discriminability (d' approx 0), indicating inability to reliably distinguish synthetic from human voices rather than simple response bias. Qualitative analysis of 315 coded excerpts revealed reliance on paralinguistic and emotional heuristics, including pauses, filler words, vocal variability, cadence, and emotional expressiveness. However, these surface-level cues traditionally associated with human authenticity were frequently replicated by AI-generated samples. Misclassifications were often accompanied by moderate to high confidence, suggesting perceptual miscalibration rather than uncertainty. Together, our findings demonstrate that authenticity judgments based on vocal heuristics are unreliable in contemporary vishing scenarios. We discuss implications for security interventions, user education, and AI-mediated deception mitigation.

Abstract: LLM agents are evolving rapidly, powered by code execution, tools, and the recently introduced agent skills feature. Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions. Although this can extend agent capabilities to new domains, it creates an increasingly complex agent supply chain, offering new surfaces for prompt injection attacks. We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks. Our benchmark is available at https://www.skill-inject.com/.
