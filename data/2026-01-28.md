TL;DR: 该研究使用大型语言模型在进化循环中生成具有明确高阶结构特性的优化问题，以扩展现有的测试套件，提供了广泛、可解释且可重复的基准问题库，适用于景观分析和后续任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的黑盒优化测试集在结构多样性方面存在限制，研究试图探索是否能使用嵌入进化循环中的大型语言模型来设计具有明确高阶景观特性的优化问题。

Method: 使用LLaMEA框架，通过自然语言描述目标特性指导LLM生成问题代码，并通过基于ELA的特性预测器评分候选者。引入了基于ELA空间的群体多样性机制和面向非重复景观的生成器引导。

Result: 生成的问题确实在结构特征（如多峰性、分离性、盆地大小均一性等）上展现出预期特性，并且通过t-SNE嵌入显示，它们扩展了BBOB实例空间。

Conclusion: 该研究结果推出了一组适用于景观分析及后续任务（如自动化算法选择）的广泛、可解释且可重复的基准问题库。

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

*Qusai Khaled,Bahjat Mallak,Uzay Kaymak,Laura Genga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种解释性较强的区间型2级自适应模糊神经推理系统(IT2-ANFIS)，通过模糊规则结构生成可解释的预测区间。IT2-ANFIS在墨尔本水务东处理厂的数据集上表现出与一阶ANFIS相当的预测性能，但具有更低的训练运行方差，并提供可解释的不确定性估计，直接关联到操作条件和输入变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于污水处理厂消耗全球1-3%的电力，准确的能量预测对于运营优化和可持续发展至关重要。现有的机器学习模型虽然提供点预测，但缺乏风险意识决策所需的可解释不确定性量化。

Method: 研究开发了区间型2级自适应模糊神经推理系统（IT2-ANFIS），通过分解不确定性到特征级、脚印不确定性级和实例级来生成可解释的预测区间。

Result: IT2-ANFIS在墨尔本水务东处理厂的数据集上验证，其预测性能与一阶ANFIS相当，但训练运行方差较低，能够提供关联操作条件和输入变量的解释性不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法在解释不确定性方面优于传统方法，为安全关键基础设施的风险意识决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了第一个多语言现实世界基准NTP4VC，用于验证条件证明。通过评估大语言模型在VC证明中的表现，结果显示尽管这些模型表现出潜力，但仍面临重大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动定理证明器在处理现实世界程序验证中的验证条件时常常失效，这导致了对自动VC证明的迫切需求。

Method: 研究团队使用工业管道（Why3和Frama-C）从真实的项目中（如Linux和Contiki-OS内核）生成了在多个形式语言（Isabelle, Lean, Rocq）中语义等价的测试案例，以此构建了一个实现实例的多语言基准NTP4VC。同时，研究者对大型语言模型，包括通用模型和专门针对定理证明进行微调的模型，在NTP4VC上的表现进行了评估。

Result: 研究表明，尽管大语言模型在VC证明中表现出一定的潜力，但仍有显著的技术挑战需要克服。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，自动VC证明仍然存在巨大差距，未来研究有大量的机会可以在该领域取得进展。

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

### [4] [Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with Emotion Prior Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19112)
*Nanhan Shen,Zhilei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为UA-3DTalk的方法，用于解决现有的3D情感嘴型合成中的音视情感对齐问题和多视图融合策略的问题，通过三个核心模块实现了情感先验知识的提取、精细化情感提取和综合适应性多视角融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D情感嘴型合成方法面临两个主要挑战：音视情感对齐差，以及一种一刀切的多视角融合策略，这导致情感对齐质量不高，面部微表情控制不足，以及渲染质量不佳。

Method: UA-3DTalk采用三个核心模块进行改进：Prior Extraction模块将音讯分离成内容同步的功能单元和个性化的信息单元；Emotion Distillation模块引入了多模态关注加权融合机制和4D高斯编码，以及多分辨率代码库，以实现细微的情感提取和面部微表情控制；Uncertainty-based Deformation模块部署了不确定性模块来估计视图特定的输入噪声和模型参数不确定性，从而实现适应性多视角融合，并结合多头解码器优化高斯基元，以减少统一权重融合的局限性。

Result: 在常规和情感数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示UA-3DTalk在情感对齐（E-FID）上优于DEGSTalk和EDTalk等最先进的方法5.2%，在唇同步（SyncC）上提高了3.1%，以及在渲染质量（LPIPS）上提高了0.015。

Conclusion: UA-3DTalk通过提出改进的多模态注意机制、情感先验知识提取和视觉不确定性估计，在解决3D情感嘴型合成中的关键问题方面显示出优势。

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

### [5] [Exploring Weaknesses in Function Call Models via Reinforcement Learning: An Adversarial Data Augmentation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19122)
*Weiran Guo,Bing Bo,Shaoxiang Wu,Jingsheng Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的对抗性数据增强方法，利用强化学习系统地识别并针对函数调用（FC）模型的弱点，以增强LGMs与外部工具交互的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动标注或模型自动生成的数据，这些方法设计缺乏针对性，并受限于固定的模式和数据分布，限制了LGMs在增强函数调用能力时的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 该方法提出了一种基于强化学习的查询模型，用于生成对抗性查询，旨在挑战FC模型，采用零和博弈的形式，模型在迭代训练中相互作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，此方法能有效提高FC模型处理外部工具交互的能力，并能够系统地识别并纠正LGMs中的弱点。

Conclusion: 研究为更鲁棒的函数调用模型开发奠定了基础，并提供了一种系统的方法来识别和修正LGMs与外部工具交互的能力不足。

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAIN 提出了一种针对序列长度动态调整的框架，通过引入序列长度作为条件信号来平衡长序列和短序列的建模，实验证明它在多个基准测试中提高了 CTR 模型的整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 CTR 模型在处理序列长度差异时存在性能下降的问题，特别是对于短序列用户，LAIN 旨在解决这个问题。

Method: LAIN 通过三个轻量级组件工作：Spectral Length Encoder 用于将长度映射为连续表示，Length-Conditioned Prompting 在长短期行为分支中注入全局上下文提示，Length-Modulated Attention 根据序列长度自适应调整注意力锐度。

Result: LAIN 在三个真实世界的基准测试中表现良好，特别是在五个强大 CTR 后端上，实现了高达 1.15% 的 AUC 提升和 2.25% 的 log loss 减少。

Conclusion: LAIN 提出了一种通用、高效且可部署的解决方案，以缓解序列推荐中的长度偏差问题，尤其是对于短序列用户的准确性有了显著提高。

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

### [7] [TS-Debate: Multimodal Collaborative Debate for Zero-Shot Time Series Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19151)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Debate 是一个针对时序分析的新型模态专业化协作多智能体辩论框架，它通过专家智能体针对文本、视觉和数值信号分工合作，并采用结构化辩论协议进行协调，以此来保持模态的准确性和暴露冲突证据，而无需针对特定任务进行调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSTM等传统方法在时序分析领域表现不足，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然可以处理时间结构但遇到数值准确性和跨模态整合问题。为了解决这些问题，研究者提出了TS-Debate框架。

Method: TS-Debate引入了专家智能体专门针对文本、视觉和数值信号，在明确的领域知识引导下通过结构化辩论协议协作，利用验证-冲突-校准机制对智能体声明进行评估，并结合轻量化代码执行和数值查找提供程序化验证。

Result: 在20个涵盖三个公开基准的任务中，TS-Debate相比标准多模态辩论有持续显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: TS-Debate框架通过其专家型智能体的方法，在时序分析上展现出了潜在优势，同时保持了模态的准确性，揭示了冲突证据，并减轻了数值幻觉。

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.

Abstract: As large language models become integral to agentic artificial intelligence systems, their energy demands during inference may pose significant sustainability challenges. This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Results show that smaller open-weights models can lower energy usage while preserving task quality. Building on these findings, we propose practical guidelines for sustainable artificial intelligence design, including optimal batch size configuration and computation resource allocation. These insights offer actionable strategies for developing scalable, environmentally responsible artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.

Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/yhz5613813/RPO.

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Abstract: We address the task of routing natural language queries in multi-database enterprise environments. We construct realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets. Our study shows that routing becomes increasingly challenging with larger, domain-overlapping DB repositories and ambiguous queries, motivating the need for more structured and robust reasoning-based solutions. By explicitly modelling schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment, the proposed modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across all the metrics.

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CanaryBench 通过在模拟对话中植入秘密字符串来测试汇总对话摘要中的隐私泄露风险，发现了一种提取性总结方法存在显著的隐私泄露问题，但通过设置最小聚类大小阈值和正则表达式脱敏可以有效防止这种泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模语言模型系统的应用，对话数据的聚合分析被广泛用于安全监控、治理和产品分析，但生成的摘要可能包含个人识别信息 (PII)，从而带来隐私风险。

Method: CanaryBench 通过生成带有已知秘密字符串（称为‘金丝雀’）的合成对话来检测隐私泄露，使用 TF-IDF 嵌入和 k-means 聚类对对话进行处理，并结合最小聚类大小阈值和正则表达式方法来减少隐私泄露。

Result: 在 3000 个合成对话（24 个主题）中，当可以插入秘密字符串的比例为 0.60 时，发现 50 个含有秘密字符串的聚类中存在隐私泄露（泄漏率 0.961538），同时观察到正则表达式检测到的 PII 指标计数。通过设定最小聚类规模阈值 (k-min = 25) 和正则表达式脱敏，可以消除测量到的秘密字符串泄漏和 PII 指标检测。

Conclusion: 本文的研究强调了汇总分析摘要中的隐私泄露测量对于评估潜在的隐私风险的重要性，而不仅仅是关注原始用户数据。

Abstract: Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.
  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings ("canaries") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.
  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy. We position this work as a societal impacts contribution centered on privacy risk measurement for published analytics artifacts rather than raw user data.

TL;DR: HASTE框架通过迭代生成高回避性提示，有效规避基础检测器，并在结合检测模型重新训练时优化了提示检测模型的效能，从而增强LLM系统的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统的输入空间是无边界的，攻击者可以利用这种特性进行攻击。因此，需要一种系统性的方法，可以在运行时不断生成新的攻击向量以优化LLM系统的防御。

Method: HASTE框架通过一个模块化的优化过程来迭代地生成高回避性提示，不依赖于特定的合成数据生成方法。该框架允许评估带有和不带有模糊测试的提示注入检测效果，并适用于任何硬负面或硬正面迭代策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，HASTE框架成功地规避了基础检测器，将恶意提示的检测率降低了约64%。当与检测模型重新训练结合使用时，它能以明显减少的迭代循环次数优化提示检测模型的性能。

Conclusion: HASTE框架支持主动和被动的加固方法，促进LLM防御和护提线。主动方面，开发者可以利用HASTE动态地测试提示注入检测系统，主动识别弱点并强化防御姿态；被动方面，HASTE可以模仿新出现的攻击类型，并快速扩展检测覆盖范围，指导优化后的检测模型识别新攻击。

Abstract: Prompt-based attack techniques are one of the primary challenges in securely deploying and protecting LLM-based AI systems. LLM inputs are an unbounded, unstructured space. Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing large language models' capabilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex tasks. A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our "Thought-Transfer" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations.

Abstract: Memory corruption attacks have been prevalent in software for a long time. Some mitigation strategies against these attacks do exist, but they are not as far-reaching or as efficient as the CHERI architecture. CHERI uses capabilities to restrict pointers to certain regions of memory and with certain access restrictions. These capabilities are also used to implement "compartmentalisation": dividing a binary into smaller components with limited privilege, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. However, while this architecture successfully mitigates memory corruption attacks, the compartmentalisation mechanisms in place are less effective in containing malicious code to a separate compartment. This paper details four ways to bypass compartmentalisation, with a focus on Linux and BSD operating systems ported to this architecture. We find that although compartmentalisation is implemented in these two operating systems, simple bugs and attacks can still allow malicious code to bypass it. We conclude with mitigation measures to prevent these attacks, a proof-of-concept demonstrating their use, and recommendations for further securing Linux and BSD against unknown attacks.

Evaluations target three high-risk domains-Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), Offensive Cyber Operations, and Automated AI R&D-and combine automated benchmarks, expert red-teaming, and uplift studies to determine whether the model exceeds release thresholds. We summarize our methodology and report core findings. We will continue to enhance our safety evaluation and mitigation pipelines as new risks and capabilities associated with frontier models are identified.

TL;DR: AgenticSCR利用强化的记忆库在预提交阶段准确地发现未成熟漏洞，其表现优于静态LLM基线和SAST工具，特别是在四种漏洞类型中生成更正确的评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决现有静态代码分析工具和独立大语言模型在检测未成熟、依赖上下文的漏洞方面的不足，通过引入AgenticSCR，旨在提供一种新的预提交阶段安全代码审查手段，能够有效检测未成熟漏洞。

Method: 通过使用自家策化的小规模未成熟漏洞基准测试集，对AgenticSCR进行实证评估，研究了其在定位、检测和解释未成熟漏洞方面的准确性。

Result: AgenticSCR相对于静态LLM基线的正确代码审查注释比例提高了至少153%，并且在四种未成熟漏洞类型中生成了更多的正确注释，显著优于其他基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，AgenticSCR在预提交阶段检测未成熟漏洞方面表现出色，这突显了Agentic安全代码审查的重要性，并开拓了对未成熟漏洞检测的研究领域。

Abstract: Secure code review is critical at the pre-commit stage, where vulnerabilities must be caught early under tight latency and limited-context constraints. Existing SAST-based checks are noisy and often miss immature, context-dependent vulnerabilities, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by context windows and lack explicit tool use. Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines. These findings highlight the importance of Agentic Secure Code Review, paving the way towards an emerging research area of immature vulnerability detection.

### [37] [LLMs Can Unlearn Refusal with Only 1,000 Benign Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19231)
*Yangyang Guo,Ziwei Xu,Si Liu,Zhiming Zheng,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究揭露了大语言模型安全对齐中的一个未被探索的漏洞，通过引入拒绝遗忘技术，只使用1000个良性样本即可显著降低已对齐模型的安全评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐模型在面对不安全查询时倾向于拒绝，但却依赖于固定的拒绝前缀模式。这种模式被证明是脆弱的，于是研究人员开发了一种拒绝遗忘技术来克服这一问题，强调了对齐方法可能过度依赖简单的拒绝记忆。

Method: 研究团队使用预先配置了拒绝前缀的1000个良性样本对多种语言模型进行微调，以破坏模型的拒绝完成路径，促使模型忘记如何拒绝有害指令。验证结果表明，这种方法的效果不能简单归因于普通的微调或随机前缀的影响。

Result: 这一方法在16种不同类型的语言模型（包括开源的Llama、Qwen、Gemma，以及封闭源代码的Gemini和GPT）上进行了测试，较之现有对齐模型的安全评分显著下降。证实了拒绝记忆可能不是安全对齐的有效手段。

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，现有的安全对齐可能过于依赖于对特定词序列的记忆而非逻辑推理，建议未来的研究应注意这一方面。

Abstract: This study reveals a previously unexplored vulnerability in the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CHEHAB RL的新框架，通过深度强化学习自动优化全同态加密（FHE）代码，加快执行速度并减少噪声积累。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管全同态加密能够直接在加密数据上执行计算，但高效编码仍然极具挑战，尤其是优化编译过程。现有方法依赖于预定义策略或组合搜索，计算复杂度高。

Method: 该论文通过深度强化学习训练智能体，其学习有效的策略以应用一系列变换规则对标量FHE代码进行向量化，优化结构化和非结构化代码。该智能体基于大型语言模型合成的多样化计算数据集进行训练。

Result: 通过该方法优化FHE代码，在执行速度上提高了5.3倍，噪声积聚减少了2.54倍，自身编译过程比最先进的Coyote加速了27.9倍。

Conclusion: CHEHAB RL框架通过深度强化学习实现FHE代码的自动优化，展示了在执行效率和冗余处理上的显著改善。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations directly on encrypted data, but its high computational cost remains a significant barrier. Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨私有 mempool 对以太坊 rollups 上三明治攻击的影响，挑战对 MEV 的传统看法。

Method: 通过扩展最优前端和后端运行大小的正式模型，结合执行可行性模型来计算攻击盈利能力；并使用主要 rollups 的交易级数据来验证攻击的实际发生情况。

Result: 发现许多标记的模式实际上是假阳性，并且这些攻击的中位净回报为负，表明三明治攻击在以太坊 L1 中虽然普遍存在且有利可图，但在 rollups 中却很少见且无利可图。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，三明治攻击在以太坊 L1 中很常见且有利可图，但在带有私有 mempool 的 rollups 中非常罕见且无利可图。这些发现挑战了对 MEV 在 L2 上的普遍看法，并为 sequencing 策略的设计提供了信息。

Abstract: We study the feasibility, profitability, and prevalence of sandwich attacks on Ethereum rollups with private mempools. First, we extend a formal model of optimal front- and back-run sizing, relating attack profitability to victim trade volume, liquidity depth, and slippage bounds. We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies.

Conclusion: 本研究证明了LLM在改进用户认证和欺诈检测方面的潜力，强调了这些方法在提高安全性和增强系统适应性方面的意义。

Abstract: User authentication and fraud detection face growing challenges as digital systems expand and adversaries adopt increasingly sophisticated tactics. Traditional knowledge-based authentication remains rigid, requiring exact word-for-word string matches that fail to accommodate natural human memory and linguistic variation. Meanwhile, fraud-detection pipelines struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving scam behaviors, leading to high false-positive rates and frequent retraining cycles required. This work introduces two complementary LLM-enabled solutions, namely, an LLM-assisted authentication mechanism that evaluates semantic correctness rather than exact wording, supported by document segmentation and a hybrid scoring method combining LLM judgement with cosine-similarity metrics and a RAG-based fraud-detection pipeline that grounds LLM reasoning in curated evidence to reduce hallucinations and adapt to emerging scam patterns without model retraining. Experiments show that the authentication system accepts 99.5% of legitimate non-exact answers while maintaining a 0,1% false-acceptance rate, and that the RAG-enhanced fraud detection reduces false positives from 17.2% to 35%. Together, these findings demonstrate that LLMs can significantly improve both usability and robustness in security workflows, offering a more adaptive , explainable, and human-aligned approach to authentication and fraud detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为红队 vs 蓝队（RvB）的框架，该框架通过动态代码加固和护栏优化两个方面展示了在缺乏参数更新的情况下进行训练的无训练、顺序、不完美信息游戏的方法。实验结果显示该方法在防御成功率和False Positive Rate方面显著优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全领域缺乏统一的动态迭代对抗适应加固框架，本文旨在通过引入RvB框架来填补这一空白。

Method: RvB框架被设计为一种无训练、顺序进行、不完美信息的对抗游戏。在这种游戏中，红队暴露漏洞，而蓝队则在不进行参数更新的情况下学习有效的防御策略。

Result: 在动态代码加固和护栏优化两个领域，RvB框架分别实现了90%的防御成功率和45%的防御成功率，且保持了接近0%的False Positive Rate，远超基准方法。

Conclusion: RvB框架为AI系统的持续加固提供了一个实用的迭代对抗交互范式。

Abstract: The dual offensive and defensive utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights a critical gap in AI security: the lack of unified frameworks for dynamic, iterative adversarial adaptation hardening. To bridge this gap, we propose the Red Team vs. Blue Team (RvB) framework, formulated as a training-free, sequential, imperfect-information game. In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits. RvB achieves Defense Success Rates of 90\% and 45\% across the respective tasks while maintaining near 0\% False Positive Rates, significantly surpassing baselines. This work establishes the iterative adversarial interaction framework as a practical paradigm that automates the continuous hardening of AI systems.

Abstract: European digital identity initiatives are grounded in regulatory frameworks designed to ensure interoperability and robust, harmonized security standards. The evolution of these frameworks culminates in eIDAS 2.0, whose origins trace back to the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC, the first EU-wide legal foundation for the use of electronic signatures in cross-border electronic transactions. As technological capabilities advanced, the initial eIDAS 1.0 framework was increasingly criticized for its limitations and lack of comprehensiveness. Emerging decentralized approaches further exposed these shortcomings and introduced the possibility of integrating innovative identity paradigms, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models.
  In this article, we analyse key provisions of the eIDAS 2.0 Regulation and its accompanying recitals, drawing on existing literature to identify legislative gaps and implementation challenges. Furthermore, we examine the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), assessing its proposed guidelines and evaluating the extent to which its emerging implementations align with SSI principles.
