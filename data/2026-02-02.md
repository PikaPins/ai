### [1] [ShellForge: Adversarial Co-Evolution of Webshell Generation and Multi-View Detection for Robust Webshell Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22182)
*Yizhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ShellForge的对抗性共进化框架，该框架结合了自动化恶意网页 shell 生成和多视角检测，旨在应对恶意网页 shell 的快速变异和复杂的规避技术，同时减少误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检测机制难以跟上恶意网页 shell 快速变化的变体和复杂的混淆技术，而常见的防御措施又经常在遇到对知识产权进行强烈混淆保护的合法管理脚本时产生较高的误报率。因此，本文提出了一种对抗性共进化框架来解决这些问题。

Method: ShellForge通过迭代共训练循环来优化生成器和检测器，生成器通过监督微调和基于偏好的强化学习来合成功能强大且高度规避的变体；同时开发了结合语义、结构和全局统计特征的多视角融合检测器，利用基于大语言模型（LLM）的转换技术创建无害样本以减少误报。

Result: 在公共FWOID基准测试上，ShellForge显著增强了防御能力，最终达到0.981的F1分数，生成器实现了相对于VirusTotal商业引擎的0.939的规避率。

Conclusion: ShellForge在应对恶意网页 shell 的挑战方面取得了显著成果，通过多视角检测与生成对抗性的相互优化，提供了一种有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Webshells remain a primary foothold for attackers to compromise servers, particularly within PHP ecosystems. However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness. Upon convergence, the detector maintains a 0.981 F1-score while the generator achieves a 0.939 evasion rate against commercial engines on VirusTotal.

### [2] [MemeChain: A Multimodal Cross-Chain Dataset for Meme Coin Forensics and Risk Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22185)
*Alberto Maria Mongardini,Alessandro Mei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MemeChain，这是一个大型的跨链数据集，包含34,988个跨Ethereum、BNB Smart Chain、Solana和Base的meme币。MemeChain集成了区块链和非区块链指标，揭示了meme币生态系统的特征并为金融取证研究提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着meme币成为加密货币市场中最活跃但也最不透明的领域之一，现有的数据集通常仅覆盖单一区块链，缺乏跨链和丰富的非区块链信息。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过MemeChain数据集为金融取证提供支持。

Method: MemeChain数据集包含了34,988个跨多个区块链的meme币信息，整合了链上和链下数据，如网站HTML、代币logo和社交媒体资料，通过这种方法能够进行多模态和取证分析。

Result: 分析发现，许多meme币项目缺乏视觉品牌建设，几乎没有功能性的网站，并且有1,801个（约5.15%）的代币在启动后的24小时内停止交易活动。该数据集帮助量化了meme币生态系统的极端波动性。

Conclusion: MemeChain作为一个大型的开放源跨链数据集，提供了统一的跨链覆盖率及丰富的非区块链环境信息，为金融取证研究、多模态异常检测以及自动欺诈预防提供了基础资源。

Abstract: The meme coin ecosystem has grown into one of the most active yet least observable segments of the cryptocurrency market, characterized by extreme churn, minimal project commitment, and widespread fraudulent behavior. While countless meme coins are deployed across multiple blockchains, they rely heavily on off-chain web and social infrastructure to signal legitimacy. These very signals are largely absent from existing datasets, which are often limited to single-chain data or lack the multimodal artifacts required for comprehensive risk modeling.
  To address this gap, we introduce MemeChain, a large-scale, open-source, cross-chain dataset comprising 34,988 meme coins across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. MemeChain integrates on-chain data with off-chain artifacts, including website HTML source code, token logos, and linked social media accounts, enabling multimodal and forensic study of meme coin projects. Analysis of the dataset shows that visual branding is frequently omitted in low-effort deployments, and many projects lack a functional website. Moreover, we quantify the ecosystem's extreme volatility, identifying 1,801 tokens (5.15%) that cease all trading activity within just 24 hours of launch. By providing unified cross-chain coverage and rich off-chain context, MemeChain serves as a foundational resource for research in financial forensics, multimodal anomaly detection, and automated scam prevention in the meme coin ecosystem.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by the emergence of new security vulnerabilities and challenges, such as jailbreaking and other prompt injection attacks. These maliciously crafted inputs can exploit LLMs, causing data leaks, unauthorized actions, or compromised outputs, for instance. As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems.

### [4] [MirrorMark: A Distortion-Free Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22246)
*Ya Jiang,Massieh Kordi Boroujeny,Surender Suresh Kumar,Kai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MirrorMark 是一种为大规模语言模型设计的多比特且无损水印方法，通过保留采样随机性并引入上下文调度器来改善鲁棒性，从而在保持文本质量的同时显著提高了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在应用程序中的广泛应用，准确的内容归属变得越来越重要。现有的水印方法要么只提供二进制信号，要么对采样分布产生扭曲，降低文本质量；无损的水印方法虽然存在，但在鲁棒性方面往往较弱。因此，提出一种多比特且无损的水印方法 MirrorMark 以解决这些问题。

Method: MirrorMark 通过一种保测度的采样随机性镜像机制，在不改变token概率分布的情况下嵌入多比特信息，从而保持文本质量。另外，还设计了一个基于上下文的调度器来平衡消息位置上的token分配，并保持对插入和删除的抵抗力。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入 54 个比特至 300 个 token 中时，MirrorMark 能够保持与非水印生成相同的文本质量，在检测能力上具有显著优势：比特准确率提升 8-12%，在 1% 的误报率下能够正确识别到多出 11% 的被水印文本。

Conclusion: MirrorMark 是一种有效的方法，能够确保在大规模语言模型生成内容时同时保持文本质量和高可见性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to applications such as question answering and content creation, reliable content attribution has become increasingly important. Watermarking is a promising approach, but existing methods either provide only binary signals or distort the sampling distribution, degrading text quality; distortion-free approaches, in turn, often suffer from weak detectability or robustness. We propose MirrorMark, a multi-bit and distortion-free watermark for LLMs. By mirroring sampling randomness in a measure-preserving manner, MirrorMark embeds multi-bit messages without altering the token probability distribution, preserving text quality by design. To improve robustness, we introduce a context-based scheduler that balances token assignments across message positions while remaining resilient to insertions and deletions. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the equal error rate to interpret empirical performance. Experiments show that MirrorMark matches the text quality of non-watermarked generation while achieving substantially stronger detectability: with 54 bits embedded in 300 tokens, it improves bit accuracy by 8-12% and correctly identifies up to 11% more watermarked texts at 1% false positive rate.

### [5] [Rethinking Anonymity Claims in Synthetic Data Generation: A Model-Centric Privacy Attack Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22434)
*Georgi Ganev,Emiliano De Cristofaro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了合成数据的匿名性主张，从模型中心角度出发，认为有意义的安全评估需考虑模型的能力和属性，以及最新的隐私攻击。研究认为，单独使用合成数据技术并不能确保足够的匿名性，讨论了差分隐私（DP）与相似性隐私度量（SBPMs）在抵御可识别风险的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章指出当前隐私评估主要基于个体数据集的匿名性，但忽略了模型自身带来的隐私风险，因此从模型中心视角重新审视合成数据的匿名性主张，强调了评估应基于最新的隐私攻击技术，并指出单独使用合成数据技术不足以确保足够的匿名性。

Method: 研究者通过重新定义GDPR中关于个人数据和匿名化的定义，基于对模型访问假设的理解来识别可识别性风险，并将其映射到不同威胁情况下的隐私攻击。比较了常用的两种隐私保护机制：差分隐私（DP）和相似性隐私度量（SBPMs），强调了DP的有效性与SBPMs的不足。

Result: 研究提出了一个框架，将监管理解和模型中心的隐私攻击联系起来，为研究者、实践者和政策制定者提供了合成数据系统更负责任和可信赖的隐私评估方法。它强调了单独使用合成数据技术可能无法提供足够的匿名保护，并建议结合使用差分隐私技术。

Conclusion: 文章呼吁结合使用差分隐私等机制来增强合成数据系统的隐私保护，从而确保在模型中心视角下更真实的匿名性风险评估和防御措施。

Abstract: Training generative machine learning models to produce synthetic tabular data has become a popular approach for enhancing privacy in data sharing. As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.
  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

### [6] [FraudShield: Knowledge Graph Empowered Defense for LLMs against Fraud Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22485)

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FraudShield是一种利用欺诈手法关键词知识图谱保护大型语言模型免受恶意信息干扰的新框架，它通过结构化知识图谱增强输入文本，提高模型安全性并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型被广泛应用于关键自动化工作流程，它们面临被欺诈信息操控的风险，这可能导致有害后果。尽管开发了先进的防御方法，但这些方法在效果、可解释性和泛化性方面存在局限，特别是在LLM应用中的表现不理想。因此，研究人员需要一种新的框架来应对这些挑战。

Method: FraudShield框架通过构建并精炼欺诈手法关键词知识图谱，识别和关联可疑文本与欺诈技术间的高置信度关系。该知识图谱增强原始输入，突出关键词并提供支持证据，指导LLM生成更安全的响应。

Result: 实验表明，FraudShield在四种主流大型语言模型和五种典型欺诈类型上，均优于现有的最先进的防御技术，同时为模型的生成过程提供了可解释性线索。

Conclusion: FraudShield框架通过结构化知识图谱提升了大型语言模型的安全性，并提供了可解释性的生成线索，解决了现有防御方法存在的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into critical automated workflows, including contract review and job application processes. However, LLMs are susceptible to manipulation by fraudulent information, which can lead to harmful outcomes. Although advanced defense methods have been developed to address this issue, they often exhibit limitations in effectiveness, interpretability, and generalizability, particularly when applied to LLM-based applications. To address these challenges, we introduce FraudShield, a novel framework designed to protect LLMs from fraudulent content by leveraging a comprehensive analysis of fraud tactics. Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses. Extensive experiments show that FraudShield consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across four mainstream LLMs and five representative fraud types, while also offering interpretable clues for the model's generations.

### [7] [VocBulwark: Towards Practical Generative Speech Watermarking via Additional-Parameter Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22556)
*Weizhi Liu,Yue Li,Zhaoxia Yin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VocBulwark是一种额外参数注入框架，通过冻结生成模型参数以保持感知质量，同时设计Temporal Adapter和Coarse-to-Fine Gated Extractor以增强鲁棒性，并采用Accuracy-Guided Optimization Curriculum来解决保真度和鲁棒性之间的优化冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的水印方法难以在保持音质（保真度）的同时实现鲁棒性，因此需要一种新的方法来提高生成语音的水印能力，以应对复杂的实际攻击场景。

Method: VocBulwark框架采用了Temporal Adapter与Coarse-to-Fine Gated Extractor结合使用的设计，同时引入了Accuracy-Guided Optimization Curriculum来优化水印过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，VocBulwark能够实现高容量和高保真度的水印，对复杂的实用场景具有强大的防御能力，能够抵御Codec再生和长度变化等攻击。

Conclusion: VocBulwark提供了一种新的方法，可以有效地在保持自然音质的同时增强生成语音的水印能力，应对多种先进的攻击手段。

Abstract: Generated speech achieves human-level naturalness but escalates security risks of misuse. However, existing watermarking methods fail to reconcile fidelity with robustness, as they rely either on simple superposition in the noise space or on intrusive alterations to model weights. To bridge this gap, we propose VocBulwark, an additional-parameter injection framework that freezes generative model parameters to preserve perceptual quality. Specifically, we design a Temporal Adapter to deeply entangle watermarks with acoustic attributes, synergizing with a Coarse-to-Fine Gated Extractor to resist advanced attacks. Furthermore, we develop an Accuracy-Guided Optimization Curriculum that dynamically orchestrates gradient flow to resolve the optimization conflict between fidelity and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VocBulwark achieves high-capacity and high-fidelity watermarking, offering robust defense against complex practical scenarios, with resilience to Codec regenerations and variable-length manipulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to automate financial transactions, yet their reliance on contextual reasoning exposes payment systems to prompt-driven manipulation. The Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) aims to secure agent-led purchases through cryptographically verifiable mandates, but its practical robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we perform an AI red-teaming evaluation of AP2 and identify vulnerabilities arising from indirect and direct prompt injection. We introduce two attack techniques, the Branded Whisper Attack and the Vault Whisper Attack which manipulate product ranking and extract sensitive user data. Using a functional AP2 based shopping agent built with Gemini-2.5-Flash and the Google ADK framework, we experimentally validate that simple adversarial prompts can reliably subvert agent behavior. Our findings reveal critical weaknesses in current agentic payment architectures and highlight the need for stronger isolation and defensive safeguards in LLM-mediated financial systems.

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate promising performance in software vulnerability detection after fine-tuning. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the "semantic trap," where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, but their proficiency in producing secure code remains a critical, under-explored area. Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities. Our work highlights the gap between functional and secure code generation in current LLMs.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly accessed via black-box APIs, requiring users to transmit sensitive prompts, outputs, and fine-tuning data to external providers, creating a critical privacy risk at the API boundary. We introduce AlienLM, a deployable API-only privacy layer that protects text by translating it into an Alien Language via a vocabulary-scale bijection, enabling lossless recovery on the client side. Using only standard fine-tuning APIs, Alien Adaptation Training (AAT) adapts target models to operate directly on alienized inputs. Across four LLM backbones and seven benchmarks, AlienLM retains over 81\% of plaintext-oracle performance on average, substantially outperforming random-bijection and character-level baselines. Under adversaries with access to model weights, corpus statistics, and learning-based inverse translation, recovery attacks reconstruct fewer than 0.22\% of alienized tokens. Our results demonstrate a practical pathway for privacy-preserving LLM deployment under API-only access, substantially reducing plaintext exposure while maintaining task performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Creating attack paths for cyber defence exercises requires substantial expert effort. Existing automation requires vulnerability graphs or exploit sets curated in advance, limiting where it can be applied. We present AEGIS, a system that generates attack paths using LLMs, white-box access, and Monte Carlo Tree Search over real exploit execution. LLM-based search discovers exploits dynamically without pre-existing vulnerability graphs, while white-box access enables validating exploits in isolation before committing to attack paths. Evaluation at CIDeX 2025, a large-scale exercise spanning 46 IT hosts, showed that AEGIS-generated paths are comparable to human-authored scenarios across four dimensions of training experience (perceived learning, engagement, believability, challenge). Results were measured with a validated questionnaire extensible to general simulation-based training. By automating exploit chain discovery and validation, AEGIS reduces scenario development from months to days, shifting expert effort from technical validation to scenario design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is fundamental to secure online communication, yet vulnerabilities in certificate validation that enable Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks remain a pervasive threat in Android apps. Existing detection tools are hampered by low-coverage UI interaction, costly instrumentation, and a lack of scalable root-cause analysis. We present Okara, a framework that leverages foundation models to automate the detection and deep attribution of TLS MitM Vulnerabilities (TMVs). Okara's detection component, TMV-Hunter, employs foundation model-driven GUI agents to achieve high-coverage app interaction, enabling efficient vulnerability discovery at scale. Deploying TMV-Hunter on 37,349 apps from Google Play and a third-party store revealed 8,374 (22.42%) vulnerable apps. Our measurement shows these vulnerabilities are widespread across all popularity levels, affect critical functionalities like authentication and code delivery, and are highly persistent with a median vulnerable lifespan of over 1,300 days. Okara's attribution component, TMV-ORCA, combines dynamic instrumentation with a novel LLM-based classifier to locate and categorize vulnerable code according to a comprehensive new taxonomy. This analysis attributes 41% of vulnerabilities to third-party libraries and identifies recurring insecure patterns, such as empty trust managers and flawed hostname verification. We have initiated a large-scale responsible disclosure effort and will release our tools and datasets to support further research and mitigation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In modern SSDLC, program analysis and automated testing are essential for minimizing vulnerabilities before software release, with fuzzing being a fast and widely used dynamic testing method. However, traditional coverage-guided fuzzing may be less effective in specific tasks like verifying static analysis reports or reproducing crashes, while directed fuzzing, focusing on targeted program locations using proximity metrics, proves to be more effective. Some of the earliest directed fuzzers are, for example, AFLGo and BEACON, which use different proximity metric approaches. Although most automated testing tools focus on C/C++ code, the growing popularity of Rust and Go causes the need for precise and efficient testing solutions for these languages. This work expands the applicability of directed fuzzing beyond traditional analysis of C/C++ software. We present a novel approach to directed greybox fuzzing tailored specifically for Rust and Go applications. We introduce advanced preprocessing techniques, rustc compiler customizations, and elaborate graph construction and instrumentation methods to enable effective targeting of specific program locations. Our implemented fuzzing tools, based on LibAFL-DiFuzz backend, demonstrate competitive advantages compared to popular existing fuzzers like afl.rs, cargo-fuzz, and go-fuzz. According to TTE (Time to Exposure) experiments, Rust-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms other tools by the best TTE result. Some stability issues can be explained by different mutation approaches. Go-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms its opponent by the best and, in the majority of cases, by average result, having two cases with orders of magnitude difference. These results prove better efficiency and accuracy of our approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is the most essential component for polynomial multiplications used in lattice-based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms such as Kyber, Dilithium, NTRU etc. However, side-channel attacks (SCA) and hardware vulnerabilities in the form of hardware Trojans may alter control signals to disrupt the circuit's control flow and introduce unconventional delays in the critical hardware of PQC. Hardware Trojans, especially on control signals, are more low cost and impactful than data signals because a single corrupted control signal can disrupt or bypass entire computation sequences, whereas data faults usually cause only localized errors. On the other hand, adversaries can perform Soft Analytical Side Channel Attacks (SASCA) on the design using the inserted hardware Trojan. In this paper, we present a secure NTT architecture capable of detecting unconventional delays, control-flow disruptions, and SASCA, while providing an adaptive fault-correction methodology for their mitigation. Extensive simulations and implementations of our Secure NTT on Artix-7 FPGA with different Kyber variants show that our fault detection and correction modules can efficiently detect and correct faults whether caused unintentionally or intentionally by hardware Trojans with a high success rate, while introducing only modest area and time overheads.

Abstract: Fine-tuned LLMs can covertly encode prompt secrets into outputs via steganographic channels. Prior work demonstrated this threat but relied on trivially recoverable encodings. We formalize payload recoverability via classifier accuracy and show previous schemes achieve 100\% recoverability. In response, we introduce low-recoverability steganography, replacing arbitrary mappings with embedding-space-derived ones. For Llama-8B (LoRA) and Ministral-8B (LoRA) trained on TrojanStego prompts, exact secret recovery rises from 17$\rightarrow$30\% (+78\%) and 24$\rightarrow$43\% (+80\%) respectively, while on Llama-70B (LoRA) trained on Wiki prompts, it climbs from 9$\rightarrow$19\% (+123\%), all while reducing payload recoverability. We then discuss detection. We argue that detecting fine-tuning-based steganographic attacks requires approaches beyond traditional steganalysis. Standard approaches measure distributional shift, which is an expected side-effect of fine-tuning. Instead, we propose a mechanistic interpretability approach: linear probes trained on later-layer activations detect the secret with up to 33\% higher accuracy in fine-tuned models compared to base models, even for low-recoverability schemes. This suggests that malicious fine-tuning leaves actionable internal signatures amenable to interpretability-based defenses.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale quantum computers poses a significant threat to contemporary network security protocols, including Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)-Enterprise authentication. To mitigate this threat, the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is critical. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of PQC algorithms on WPA-Enterprise-based authentication. To this end, we conduct an experimental evaluation of authentication latency using a testbed built with the open-source tools FreeRADIUS and hostapd, measuring the time spent at the client, access point, and RADIUS server. We evaluate multiple combinations of PQC algorithms and analyze their performance overhead in comparison to currently deployed cryptographic schemes. Beyond performance, we assess the security implications of these algorithm choices by relating authentication mechanisms to the quantum effort required for their exploitation. This perspective enables a systematic categorization of PQ-relevant weaknesses in WPA-Enterprise according to their practical urgency. The evaluation results show that, although PQC introduces additional authentication latency, combinations such as ML-DSA-65 and Falcon-1024 used in conjunction with ML-KEM provide a favorable trade-off between security and performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the resulting overhead can be effectively mitigated through session resumption. Overall, this work presents a first real-world performance evaluation of PQC-enabled WPA-Enterprise authentication and demonstrates its practical feasibility for enterprise Wi-Fi deployments.

Abstract: Early detection of security bug reports (SBRs) is critical for timely vulnerability mitigation. We present an evaluation of prompt-based engineering and fine-tuning approaches for predicting SBRs using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a distinct trade-off between the two approaches. Prompted proprietary models demonstrate the highest sensitivity to SBRs, achieving a G-measure of 77% and a recall of 74% on average across all the datasets, albeit at the cost of a higher false-positive rate, resulting in an average precision of only 22%. Fine-tuned models, by contrast, exhibit the opposite behavior, attaining a lower overall G-measure of 51% but substantially higher precision of 75% at the cost of reduced recall of 36%. Though a one-time investment in building fine-tuned models is necessary, the inference on the largest dataset is up to 50 times faster than that of proprietary models. These findings suggest that further investigations to harness the power of LLMs for SBR prediction are necessary.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) increasingly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide advanced features like code autocomplete. While powerful, training these models on user-written code introduces significant privacy risks, making the models themselves a new type of data vulnerability. Malicious actors can exploit this by launching attacks to reconstruct sensitive training data or infer whether a specific code snippet was used for training. This paper investigates the use of Differential Privacy (DP) as a robust defense mechanism for training an LLM for Kotlin code completion. We fine-tune a \texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features.

Abstract: As intelligent sensing expands into high-privacy environments such as restrooms and changing rooms, the field faces a critical privacy-security paradox. Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used for software security tasks. These models are commonly trained and evaluated on large Internet-derived datasets, which often contain duplicated or highly similar samples. When such samples are split across training and test sets, data leakage may occur, allowing models to memorize patterns instead of learning to generalize. We investigate duplication in a widely used benchmark dataset of hard coded secrets and show how data leakage can substantially inflate the reported performance of AI-based secret detectors, resulting in a misleading picture of their real-world effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in sensitive domains such as healthcare and financial institutions' data analytics; however, their execution pipelines remain vulnerable to manipulation and unverifiable behavior. Existing control mechanisms, such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP), define compliance policies for tool invocation but lack verifiable enforcement and transparent validation of model actions. To address this gap, we propose a novel Secure Tool Manifest and Digital Signing Framework, a structured and security-aware extension of Model Context Protocols. The framework enforces cryptographically signed manifests, integrates transparent verification logs, and isolates model-internal execution metadata from user-visible components to ensure verifiable execution integrity. Furthermore, the evaluation demonstrates that the framework scales nearly linearly (R-squared = 0.998), achieves near-perfect acceptance of valid executions while consistently rejecting invalid ones, and maintains balanced model utilization across execution pipelines.

Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.

Abstract: Efficient waste sorting is crucial for enabling circular-economy practices and resource recovery in smart cities. This paper evaluates both traditional machine-learning (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) and deep-learning techniques including custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, and three transfer-learning models (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) for binary classification of 25 077 waste images (80/20 train/test split, augmented and resized to 150x150 px). The paper assesses the impact of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on traditional models. DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy (91 %) and ROC-AUC (0.98), outperforming the best traditional classifier by 20 pp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed negligible benefit for classical methods, whereas transfer learning substantially improved performance under limited-data conditions. Finally, we outline how these models integrate into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System for automated waste sorting, highlighting potential reductions in landfill use and lifecycle environmental impacts.)

Abstract: In this highly competitive employment environment, the selection of suitable personnel is essential for organizational success. This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks but suffer from high computational costs and latency. While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.

Abstract: Intrinsic Motivation (IM) is a paradigm for generating intelligent behavior without external utilities. The existing information-theoretic methods for IM are predominantly based on information transmission, which explicitly depends on the designer's choice of which random variables engage in transmission. In this work, we introduce a novel IM principle, Controllable Information Production (CIP), that avoids both external utilities and designer-specified variables. We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors. CIP appears as the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, which simultaneously rewards the pursuit and regulation of chaos. We establish key theoretical properties of CIP and demonstrate its effectiveness on standard IM benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) achieve notable success in iteratively improving alignment without external feedback. Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents facilitate Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation but struggle with long-horizon, cross-application tasks due to limited context windows. While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.

Abstract: A major challenge in training TableQA agents, compared to standard text- and image-based agents, is that answers cannot be inferred from a static input but must be reasoned through stepwise transformations of the table state, introducing multi-step reasoning complexity and environmental interaction. This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability. The repository is available at https://github.com/ThomasK1018/RE_Tab .

Abstract: Sampling-based decoding underlies complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where decoding strategies critically shape model behavior. Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies. Experiments on multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate improved generation performance, with gains in robustness and diversity metrics.

Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain) is challenging due to event rarity and dynamics. Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HQ-LV/WED-Net.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved mathematical reasoning through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Interactive tool-using agents must solve real-world tasks via multi-turn interaction with both humans and external environments, requiring dialogue state tracking, multi-step tool execution, while following complex instructions. Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models. Overall, our results suggest a scalable pathway for bootstrapping complex tool-using behaviors without expensive human annotation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks through extended chain-of-thought generation, but their reliance on lengthy intermediate steps incurs substantial computational cost. We find that the entropy of the model's output distribution in early reasoning steps reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose EntroCut, a training-free method that dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where reasoning can be safely terminated. To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements have increasingly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct autonomous agents for complex problem-solving tasks. However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.

Motivation: 当前对大语言模型的安全评估主要集中在单次或预算有限的对抗提示攻击上，忽略了大规模并行采样这种更为现实的风险评估。作者希望开发一种更准确的方法来预测模型在大规模对抗攻击下的风险，以更好地保护用户免受潜在危害。

Method: 本文方法SABER通过使用贝塔分布建模样本级的成功概率，并推导出可扩展的缩放定律，使得从少量（如100个）采样数据预测大规模（如1000个）攻击的成功率成为可能。

Result: SABER方法仅使用100个样本即可预测1000个样本攻击的成功率，均方绝对误差为1.66，比基准方法低86.2%。此外，实验结果揭示了模型风险随并行攻击压力呈现非线性放大的特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为快速且经济地评估大型语言模型的安全性提供了一个切实可行的方法，对于未来对抗模型攻击的研究有着重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.

TL;DR: 该研究指出现有的生成性医疗AI在基准测试中表现出色，但仍存在不适用于临床环境的行为，提出了Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI)作为真实临床应用所需的能力，并开发了Meddollina系统来更好地适应临床需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为现有的生成性医疗AI存在结构上的问题，主要表现为生成过程中的决定过早闭合、过度自信、意图漂移和决策过程中的不稳定性。因此，作者提出了Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI)和Meddollina系统来解决这些问题。

Method: 研究者通过分析现有的生成性医疗AI系统，定义了Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI)作为一种需要在现实临床环境中应用的能力，它强调持续的上下文感知、意图保持、边界推理和在证据不足时的原则性推辞。接着，他们开发了Meddollina系统，该系统在推理前先约束语义表达，优先考虑临床适宜性而非生成的完整性。然后使用包含16,412多个异质医疗查询的测试集对Meddollina系统进行了评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，Meddollina系统在不确定性校准、在不充分描述情况下的保守推理、稳定性以及减少推测性完成方面的行为与基于生成的方法相比有所改善。这表明部署医疗AI不能仅靠扩展规模，而是需要向连续临床智能转变，以临床联动的行为来评估在不确定条件下的进展。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁医疗AI的发展应朝着连续临床智能的方向前进，通过确保临床适宜性和稳健的推理来提高临床安全性。

Abstract: Generative medical AI now appears fluent and knowledgeable enough to resemble clinical intelligence, encouraging the belief that scaling will make it safe. But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.
  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.
  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.
  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.

Conclusion: UCPO框架为解决大语言模型中固有的优势偏差问题提供了一种创新的方法，提高了模型在实际应用中的可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: The key to building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in endowing them with inherent uncertainty expression capabilities to mitigate the hallucinations that restrict their high-stakes applications. However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.

Conclusion: TALC 通过专知识别的路径和自适应规划方法，有效提升了任务处理的成功率和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种新的RLHF框架，该框架通过实时利用策略模型的反馈来调整奖励模型，为改善奖励模型的性能提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.

Abstract: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating each task as an independent challenge. Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets. A continuous maintenance mechanism scores, prunes, and merges patterns to prevent repository degradation. Evaluated on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieves 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% respectively, with 20-73% step reductions. On TravelPlanner, automatic extraction exceeds manually designed systems (27.1% vs 12.1%), demonstrating its ability to capture procedural coordination.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks through iterative information retrieval. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for search-augmented reasoning predominantly rely on sparse outcome-level rewards, leading to a "Double Homogenization Dilemma." This manifests as (1) Process homogenization, where the thinking, reasoning, and tooling involved in generation are ignored. (2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-quality interaction trajectories are essential for advancing mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.

Abstract: The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have shown strong performance through extended chain-of-thought reasoning, yet their computational cost remains significant. Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.

Abstract: Code verifiers play a critical role in post-verification for LLM-based code generation, yet existing supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from data scarcity, high failure rates, and poor inference efficiency. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

Abstract: The standard approach to representation learning on attributed graphs -- i.e., simultaneously reconstructing node attributes and graph structure -- is geometrically flawed, as it merges two potentially incompatible metric spaces. This forces a destructive alignment that erodes information about the graph's underlying generative process. To recover this lost signal, we introduce a custom variational autoencoder that separates manifold learning from structural alignment. By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor. Experiments show our method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches, proving both their theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled rapid progress in automatic heuristic discovery (AHD), yet most existing methods are predominantly limited by static evaluation against fixed instance distributions, leading to potential overfitting and poor generalization under distributional shifts. We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve reasoning in multiple domains, yet outcome-only scalar rewards are often sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, where they merely indicate failure and provide no insight into why the reasoning fails. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process. Trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Prevailing medical AI operates on an unrealistic ''one-shot'' model, diagnosing from a complete patient file. However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at https://github.com/yf-he/EvoClinician

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a cornerstone for unlocking complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from isolated predictors into complex, heterogeneous ecosystems of foundation models and specialized adapters, distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy becomes a critical governance challenge. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($dσ^2γ^{-2}\log(Nd/δ)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.

Abstract: Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization. Data and code are available at https://github.com/yuhao-zhan/DeepHalluBench.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems act through tools and evolve their behavior over long, stochastic interaction traces. This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). We also show how run likelihoods enable anomaly detection as a guardrailing signal.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools, yet existing approaches depend on high-quality synthesized trajectories selected by scoring functions and sparse outcome-based rewards, providing limited and biased supervision for learning TIR. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with more general and consequential tasks. The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.

Abstract: Large language models now solve many benchmark math problems at near-expert levels, yet this progress has not fully translated into reliable performance in real-world applications. We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.

Abstract: Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models. Benchmark and Codes are available in https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/MedMCP-Calc.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning provides a significant performance uplift to LLMs by enabling planning, exploration, and deliberation of their actions. CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost. Code, models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/seanie12/ThinkSafe.git.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.

Abstract: Time series data are integral to critical applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and environmental science. While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08. Although instruction tuning boosts open-source performance: the best-performing open-source model, LLaMA-3.1-8B, shows significant room for improvement, highlighting the complexity of temporal analysis for LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.

Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model in sequential decision making. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.
