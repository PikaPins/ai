In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $\u03b5$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u03b5\u7ea6\u675f\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u5c06\u7269\u8d44\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u907f\u96be\u6240\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u707e\u5bb3\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u5907\u7269\u8d44\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u7269\u8d44\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u707e\u540e\u6551\u63f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u03b5\u7ea6\u675f\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5546\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8634%\u7684\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u516c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6551\u63f4\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331.

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues.

Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7Lie\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u5f97\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aLieFlow\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u8bbe\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLieFlow\u80fd\u591f\u57282D\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u6563\u7fa4\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u5f97\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Lie\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f83\u5927\u5047\u8bbe\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6b64\u5904\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLieFlow\u80fd\u591f\u57282D\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u6563\u7fa4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u8bbe\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOF\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4e\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5f88\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SOF\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "SOF\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\uff0cSOF\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\u66f4\u6613\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSOF\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SOF\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u4e2d\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u4ee5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5377\u51fa\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u70b9\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u9971\u548c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5177\u6709100\u500d\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5904\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reason2Decide \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Reason2Decide\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "Reason2Decide\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "Reason2Decide\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u96f6\u6837\u672c LLM\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5206\u6d41\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ecd\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Reason2Decide\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u5374\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance.

These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u751a\u81f3\u5355\u4e00\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback.

This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations.

Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.\n  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.\n  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively).

The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation.
