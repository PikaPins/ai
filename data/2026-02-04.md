*Yiliang Song,Hongjun An,Jiangong Xiao,Haofei Zhao,Jiawei Shao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CreditAudit 提出了一种部署导向的信用审计框架，旨在评估语言模型在多种基准下的能力及波动性，通过平均性能和波动性的综合评估，为模型选择提供了一个具体标准，帮助提高模型部署的客观性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在公共基准上的表现相近但未能准确反映实际用户体验，CreditAudit旨在通过标准化评估流程减少这种差距。

Method: CreditAudit 使用一组语义对齐且非对抗性的系统提示模板，在多个基准上评估模型，并采用平均能力和波动性的综合指标来衡量模型的表现和稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，具有相似平均能力的模型在波动性上存在显著差异，稳定性风险可以在高失败成本环境下影响模型选择。

Conclusion: CreditAudit 通过2D图和信用等级提供了一个制度化的模型部署选择框架，有助于更精准地分配测试和监控资源，增强模型评估的公正性和可信度。

Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入特定度量基准和带有8种人口统计学属性注释的数据集，量化了大型语言模型生成推荐中的预测不确定性和系统性不公，并提出了新的不确定性感知评估方法和公平性基准，以提升推荐系统的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽能提供强大的零样本推荐，但预测不确定性与潜在的偏差可能影响推荐的可靠性和公平性。研究动机在于通过量化和缓解这些因素，提高LLM推荐系统的准确性和信任度。

Method: 研究整合了个性感知公平性评估，使用熵量化预测不确定性，并通过多语言和文本拼写错误等扰动测试不公性。同时，利用深度不确定性案例研究提出了新的评估方法论。

Result: 结果显示Google DeepMind的Gemini 1.5存在针对某些敏感属性的系统性不公，并且评测指标加剧了这些不公性。研究还揭示了个性相关偏见模式，并引入了基于个性画像的公平性基准，提升了解释性与公平性。

Conclusion: 研究为更安全和可解释的推荐系统奠定了基础，并呼吁未来的工作在多模型基准和适应性校准方面关注推荐系统的可靠部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent multi-LLM agent systems perform well in prompt optimization and automated problem-solving, but many either keep the solver frozen after fine-tuning or rely on a static preference-optimization loop, which becomes intractable for long-horizon tasks. We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks through multi-step interaction and reasoning at test time. While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates. Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that our approach achieves a great improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling reasoning over biomolecular structures, yet existing methods remain modality-specific and typically compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. Code is available at the project repository.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits remains heavily reliant on expert knowledge, with transistor sizing a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for average correctness often exhibit mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors on tasks where multiple responses may be reasonable. This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language model benchmarks are pervasive and computationally-efficient proxies for real-world performance. However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study operationalizes subjective perspective in artificial agents by grounding it in a minimal, phenomenologically motivated internal structure. The perspective is implemented as a slowly evolving global latent state that modulates fast policy dynamics without being directly optimized for behavioral consequences. In a reward-free environment with regime shifts, this latent structure exhibits direction-dependent hysteresis, while policy-level behavior remains comparatively reactive. I argue that such hysteresis constitutes a measurable signature of perspective-like subjectivity in machine systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains a central challenge. Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference-time scaling via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a major driver of state-of-the-art LLM performance, but it comes with substantial latency and compute costs. We address a fundamental theoretical question: how many reasoning tokens are required to solve a problem as input size grows? By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $Ω(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds. Together, our results identify fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through CoT and offer a principled tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为DeltaEvolve的新框架，旨在通过使用结构化的语义delta替换完整的代码历史记录来提高进化系统的效果，从而减少代码冗余并提供更清晰的进化指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于完整代码历史的进化系统在自动化科学发现中表现出潜力，但这些系统依赖于全量代码历史，这使得它们在上下文效率较低且进化指导较弱。

Method: 研究者通过期望最大化框架重新定义了进化智能体，其中语言模型生成候选程序（E步），系统根据评估反馈更新控制上下文（M步）。此外，他们提出了DeltaEvolve框架，使用结构化的语义delta来捕捉连续节点之间修改如何影响性能的变化，通过多级数据库和逐步披露机制进一步组织这些delta信息，减少了输入令牌的数量。

Result: 在跨不同科学领域的任务上的实证研究表明，DeltaEvolve框架在较少消耗令牌的情况下能够发现更好的解决方案，优于基于完整代码的历史驱动的进化智能体。

Conclusion: 研究者认为，DeltaEvolve框架通过减少代码冗余并提供更清晰的进化指导，为自动化科学发现提供了更高效的路径。

Abstract: LLM-driven evolutionary systems have shown promise for automated science discovery, yet existing approaches such as AlphaEvolve rely on full-code histories that are context-inefficient and potentially provide weak evolutionary guidance. In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.

TL;DR: UAT-LITE在推理时通过蒙特卡洛Dropout使自注意力机制对不确定性敏感，减少模型Calibration Error，同时保持任务准确性，并提高选择性预测和对抗分布偏移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP模型往往过于自信，导致在关键决策中不可靠。因此需要一种在推理时能适应不确定性的方法。

Method: UAT-LITE通过引入基于蒙特卡洛Dropout的近似贝叶斯推理来使自注意力机制对不确定性敏感。具体地，通过对前向传递的随机波动估计单词级别知识不确定性的方法，并利用估计的结果来调整自注意力权重，从而无需修改预训练权重或训练目标。

Result: 在SQuAD 2.0、MNLI和SST-2数据集上，UAT-LITE相比微调后的BERT-base基线，平均减少约20%的预期校准误差，同时保持任务准确性，增强选择性预测和分布变化下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UAT-LITE提供了一种有效的不确定性感知推理框架，能够改善模型的不确定性表示并提高其在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Neural NLP models are often miscalibrated, assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions, which undermines selective prediction and high-stakes deployment. Post-hoc calibration methods adjust output probabilities but leave internal computation unchanged, while ensemble and Bayesian approaches improve uncertainty at substantial training or storage cost. We propose UAT-LITE, an inference-time framework that makes self-attention uncertainty-aware using approximate Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo dropout in pretrained transformer classifiers. Token-level epistemic uncertainty is estimated from stochastic forward passes and used to modulate self-attention during contextualization, without modifying pretrained weights or training objectives. We additionally introduce a layerwise variance decomposition to diagnose how predictive uncertainty accumulates across transformer depth. Across the SQuAD 2.0 answerability, MNLI, and SST-2, UAT-LITE reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 20% on average relative to a fine-tuned BERT-base baseline while preserving task accuracy, and improves selective prediction and robustness under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SEO方法在视觉内容平台上难以有效，因为图像缺乏足够的语义深度和权威信号。在生成式搜索时代，用户需求可以通过搜索引擎直接满足，无需访问网站。因此，Pinterest提出了GEO框架来适应这一变化。

Method: 该方法包括反向搜索设计、基于Vision-Language模型的微调预测用户搜索意图、利用实时互联网趋势、构建语义聚合页面，以及通过混合Vision-Language模型和两塔ANN架构在大规模图像和集合间传播权威信号。

Result: GEO成功应用于超过数十亿张图片和数千万个集合，带来了20%的有机流量增长，并促进了月活跃用户的显著增加。

Conclusion: Pinterest GEO提供了一种在生成式搜索环境中优化视觉内容平台流量的解决方案，展示了视觉平台如何在此时代继续繁荣的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamentally reshaping content discovery through AI-native search systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits.
  We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era.

Conclusion: 通过引入序理论视角，GCR-RL为强化学习提供了一种新的方法论，展示了在复杂任务上的出色性能。

Abstract: Geometric properties can be leveraged to stabilize and speed reinforcement learning. Existing examples include encoding symmetry structure, geometry-aware data augmentation, and enforcing structural restrictions. In this paper, we take a novel view of RL through the lens of order theory and recast value function estimates into learning a desired poset (partially ordered set). We propose \emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed. We empirically evaluate GCR-RL in a range of tasks and demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and stable performance over strong baselines.

*Hanna M. Dettki,Charley M. Wu,Bob Rehder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究对比了20多种大型语言模型（LLMs）和人类在几种因果推理任务上的表现，发现大多数LLMs在因果判断上表现出规则式的推理策略，不显现人类特有的认知偏差，且当提供详细解释或干扰信息时，其因果判断的稳定性得到增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨LLMs在因果推理方面的能力，尤其是在与人类相比时，它们所依赖的推理模式、是否遵循人类的行为特征以及在不同情况下其判断的可靠性。

Method: 研究通过一个特定的结构（C1 → E ← C2）下的11个因果判断任务，将各种LLMs与人类基准线进行了比较，同时探讨了LLMs在遭遇语义抽象和提示过载时的表现。

Result: 研究发现，大多数LLMs在因果判断中较多地使用规则式的推理策略，而不是考虑未提及的潜在因素。此外，大多数LLMs并未表现出人类特有的弱反竞争效应和标记违反现象。当增加详细解释或注入无关信息时，LLMs的因果判断稳定性得到提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，LLMs在某些情况下可以补充人类，特别是在存在已知偏差时。然而，当不确定性非常复杂时，它们的规则化推理可能会失败。因此，需要进一步了解LLMs的推理策略以便它们的安全和高效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \!\rightarrow\! E\! \leftarrow \!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.

*Haijiang Yan,Jian-Qiao Zhu,Adam Sanborn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种贝叶斯解释，认为LLM在推理时表现出短视的行为是由于自动生成的上下文逐渐改变其规划策略，导致了与训练中的长远规划能力不符的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在推理时表现出相对短视的行为，这和它们在训练过程中展现的长远规划能力不一致，因此需要理论解释来理解这种现象。

Method: 通过两个受控实验，即随机生成任务和高斯采样任务，来验证提出的模型。

Result: 研究发现，当人类给予提示时，LLM表现出较强的限制规划能力；随着自动生成的上下文增加，规划能力增强；同时，当以自动生成的序列为条件进行采样时，初始偏差减少。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个理论解释及其实验证据，说明了LLM在推理时如何进行逐步规划的过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to acquire sequence-level planning abilities during training, yet their planning behavior exhibited at inference time often appears short-sighted and inconsistent with these capabilities. We propose a Bayesian account for this gap by grounding planning behavior in the evolving generative context: given the subtle differences between natural language and the language internalized by LLMs, accumulated self-generated context drives a planning-shift during inference and thereby creates the appearance of compromised planning behavior. We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新的研究议程，从机器学习、经济学和民主理论的角度探讨可微社会选择的问题，为促进这些学科之间的交叉研究提供了方向和问题集。

Abstract: Social choice is no longer a peripheral concern of political theory or economics-it has become a foundational component of modern machine learning systems. From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.
  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.

TL;DR: GCP 提出了一种基于图的概念预测器的推理感知主动蒸馏框架，它通过图意识的采样策略和靶向子模块重训来提高样本效率和训练稳定性，同时在有限注解预算下提高性能并提供更可解释和可控的培训动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动蒸馏方法通常仅蒸馏最终标签，忽略中间推理信号，缺乏对推理缺失和出错原因的诊断能力。GCP 框架旨在解决这些问题，通过图化的决策过程结构进行主动蒸馏，使学生可以通过概念预测器逐步学习教师的决策过程，从而提高代码解释性和控制性。

Method: GCP 框架首先将教师的决策路径表示为有向无环图，然后在学生中构建相应模块的概念预测器。使用图意识的采样策略来选择具有最高不确定性或最大分歧的节点进行重要性评估，并仅在特定模块上执行有针对性的重新训练，直到下游损失归因给具体的概念预测器。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多种自然语言处理分类基准上，GCP 在有限注释预算下表现出更好的性能，同时提供更可解释和可控的训练动态。

Conclusion: 基于图的概念预测器的 GCP 框架在主动蒸馏中表现出色，在保持计算效率和成本效益同时，大大提高了模型的解释性和可控性。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for discriminative workloads is often limited by inference latency, compute, and API costs at scale. Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

*Haitian Zhong,Jixiu Zhai,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Qiang Liu,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RC-GRPO的新方法，通过奖励调节轨迹策略（RCTP）的微调和在每个GRPO组内采样多样化的奖励令牌来提高组内多样性，从而解决多轮工具调用中由于稀疏奖励和探索成本高昂带来的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SFT后跟随GRPO，当组内奖励变化量低时（例如，组内的所有样本获得的是全0或全1的奖励），会导致群体归一化优势不具有信息性，从而导致更新消失。因此，本文旨在通过奖励调节解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 首先，微调一个奖励调节轨迹策略（RCTP），在包含奖励目标特殊标记（如<|high_reward|>，<|low_reward|>）的混合质量轨迹上。2. 在RL过程中，遍历每个GRPO组内的多样化奖励令牌，并根据抽样到的令牌对滚动进行注释，以改进组内多样性，增加优势收益。

Result: 在伯克利函数调用领先排行榜v4（BFCLv4）的多轮基准测试中，该方法在性能上优于基线方式，并且Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct的表现甚至超过了所有闭源API模型。

Conclusion: RC-GRPO提供了一种有效的策略来增强多轮工具调用，即使在高度多样性且奖励数据稀疏的情况下也能保持有效性能。

Abstract: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, our method yields consistently improved performance than baselines, and the performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的时间序列分析方法难以整合直观的视觉推理能力，并在不同任务间进行高效的任务适配。

Method: MAS4TS 基于分析者-推理者-执行者架构，采用视觉语言模型进行时间序列图的结构化先验视觉推理，并在潜在空间中重建预测轨迹。三个智能体通过共享记忆和门控通信协同工作，同时路由器为特定任务选择合适的工具链。

Result: 在多个基准上的广泛实验表明，MAS4TS 在多种时间序列任务中达到了最先进的性能，并且具备强大的泛化能力和高效推理能力。

Conclusion: MAS4TS 为时间序列分析提供了一种新的解决方案，通过整合视觉推理和智能体协同工作，在任务特定工具链的选择和执行上表现出色。

Abstract: Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.

Conclusion: KANFIS提供了一种高效且透明的神经逻辑推理方法，扩展了传统ANFIS的应用范围，尤其适用于处理高维度数据和不确定性模糊表示。

Abstract: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was designed to combine the learning capabilities of neural network with the reasoning transparency of fuzzy logic. However, conventional ANFIS architectures suffer from structural complexity, where the product-based inference mechanism causes an exponential explosion of rules in high-dimensional spaces. We herein propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (KANFIS), a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that unifies fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition. KANFIS employs an additive aggregation mechanism, under which both model parameters and rule complexity scale linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially. Furthermore, KANFIS is compatible with both Type-1 (T1) and Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems, enabling explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity in fuzzy representations. By using sparse masking mechanisms, KANFIS generates compact and structured rule sets, resulting in an intrinsically interpretable model with clear rule semantics and transparent inference processes. Empirical results demonstrate that KANFIS achieves competitive performance against representative neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines.

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，有效且稳健的过程验证对于多智能体系统仍然是一项开放的挑战，现有范式可能需要进一步的发展。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.

Motivation: 现有方法处理缺失模态时存在痛点，如提示法难以生成准确的语义特征，而插补法易产生无关噪声。因此需要一种新的方法来提高VLM在缺失模态下的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法为VLM在缺失模态场景下的应用提供了一种有效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via long Chain-ofThought unlocks remarkable gains in reasoning capabilities, yet it faces practical limits due to the linear growth of KV cache and quadratic attention complexity. In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) that interact with real computer systems can perform automated tasks but face critical safety risks. Ambiguous instructions may trigger harmful actions, and adversarial users can manipulate tool execution to achieve malicious goals. Existing benchmarks mostly focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks, evaluating on execution-time errors but overlooking the ability to anticipate planning-time risks. To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory. Experiments reveal substantial deficiencies in existing CUAs' ability to maintain safe behavior. We further analyze the risks and propose mitigation strategies to improve long-horizon planning safety in MCP-based CUA systems. We open-source our code at https://github.com/tychenn/LPS-Bench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable interaction over both text and images, but their safety behavior can be driven by unimodal shortcuts instead of true joint intent understanding. We introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability through four stress-testing interaction patterns spanning Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, and Hallucination, covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding.

Abstract: Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.

Abstract: Enterprise meeting environments require AI assistants that handle diverse operational tasks, from rapid fact checking during live discussions to cross meeting analysis for strategic planning, under strict latency, cost, and privacy constraints. Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.
  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.
  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search.

Abstract: This paper develops a new approach to computational argumentation that is informed by philosophical and linguistic views. Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.

Abstract: Agent memory systems must accommodate continuously growing information while supporting efficient, context-aware retrieval for downstream tasks. Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework. Empirically, Memora establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.

Abstract: Mental health disorders represent a burgeoning global public health challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in psychiatric assessment, their clinical utility is severely constrained by benchmarks that lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Experiments on MentalDx Bench demonstrate that MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.

We use different interpretability techniques to uncover how moral reasoning distributes across the network, demonstrating that biases localize to distinct computational stages among other findings.

Abstract: Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.

Abstract: In three-way conflict analysis, preference-based conflict situations characterize agents' attitudes towards issues by formally modeling their preferences over pairs of issues. However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

Abstract: We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.

Abstract: Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.

Abstract: Explanations are central to human cognition, yet AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand. While symbolic AI offers a transparent foundation for interpretability, raw logical traces often impose a high extraneous cognitive load. We investigate how formal abstractions, specifically removal and clustering, impact human reasoning performance and cognitive effort. Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

Abstract: LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter.

Abstract: Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.

Abstract: World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.

Abstract: Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.

Abstract: Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. In this paper, we propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a \textbf{t}ask-\textbf{o}riented \textbf{dy}namic \textbf{comm}unication algorithm. It produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that under both dynamic adversary and communications budgets, TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness while retaining token efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.

Abstract: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习和AI时代的到来，3D内容的创建和获取需求激增，而3DGS作为一种高保真和实时表示方法受到青睐。然而，这也带来了对知识产权保护的需求增加，因为3D参数化的显式性和可编辑性使得未经授权的使用和传播更加容易。

Method: 本文建议采用基于场景的安全模型，其通过正式化对抗能力来解决安全规范和评估的空白。

Result: 基于此模型，文章构建了一个参考框架，组织现有的水印方法，并阐明特定设计选择与相应的对抗假设之间的关系。还对一种遗留的频谱扩展嵌入方案进行了分析，明确了其优缺点。

Conclusion: 本文旨在促进3D资产的有效知识产权保护，并为该领域的未来发展提供指导。

Abstract: 3D content acquisition and creation are expanding rapidly in the new era of machine learning and AI. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising high-fidelity and real-time representation for 3D content. Similar to the initial wave of digital audio-visual content at the turn of the millennium, the demand for intellectual property protection is also increasing, since explicit and editable 3D parameterization makes unauthorized use and dissemination easier. In this position paper, we argue that effective progress in watermarking 3D assets requires articulated security objectives and realistic threat models, incorporating the lessons learned from digital audio-visual asset protection over the past decades. To address this gap in security specification and evaluation, we advocate a scenario-driven formulation, in which adversarial capabilities are formalized through a security model. Based on this formulation, we construct a reference framework that organizes existing methods and clarifies how specific design choices map to corresponding adversarial assumptions. Within this framework, we also examine a legacy spread-spectrum embedding scheme, characterizing its advantages and limitations and highlighting the important trade-offs it entails. Overall, this work aims to foster effective intellectual property protection for 3D assets.

Motivation: 现有的同意管理工具和技术基础架构存在缺陷，比如系统不用户中心、数据孤岛问题以及落后的同意管理工具。因此，提出了一种基于区块链的动态同意模型的 ClinConNet平台作为解决方案。

Method: ClinConNet利用了区块链技术、动态同意界面和自我主权身份系统等先进技术，构建了一个用户中心的数据隐私和一致性管理平台。

Result: ClinConNet提供了一种新的用户体验，并支持用户隐私保护特性如匿名性、保密性和身份数据所有权等。实验证明，通过使用区块链技术，其每访问时间中位数低于200毫秒，吞吐量达到250TPS。

Conclusion: ClinConNet作为一款基于区块链的临床同意管理平台，展示了在临床研究和医疗领域中实现基于用户的隐私保护和一致健康管理的潜力和可行性。

Abstract: Consent is an ethical cornerstone of clinical research and healthcare in general. Although the ethical principles of consent - providing information, ensuring comprehension, and ensuring voluntariness - are well-defined, the technological infrastructure remains outdated. Clinicians are responsible for obtaining informed consent from research subjects or patients, and for managing it before, during, and after clinical trials or care, which is a burden for them. The voluntary nature of participating in clinical research or undergoing medical treatment implies the need for a participant-centric consent management system. However, this is not reflected in most established systems. Not only do most healthcare information systems not follow a user-centric model, but they also create data silos, which significantly reduce the mobility of patient data between different healthcare institutions and impact personalized medicine. Furthermore, consent management tools are outdated. We propose ClinConNet (Clinical Consent Network), a platform that connects researchers and participants based on clinical research projects. ClinConNet is powered by a dynamic consent model based on blockchain and take advantage of dynamic consent interfaces, as well as blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity systems. ClinConNet is user-centric and provides important privacy features for patients, such as unlinkability, confidentiality, and ownership of identity data. It is also compatible with the right to be forgotten, as defined in many personal data protection regulations, such as the GDPR. We provide a detailed privacy and security analysis in an adversarial model, as well as a Proof of Concept implementation with detailed performance measures that demonstrate the feasibility of our blockchain-based consent management system with a median end-to-end consent establishment time of under 200ms and a throughput of 250TPS.

TL;DR: TinyGuard 提出了一种轻量级的去拜占庭容错机制，通过统计更新指纹技术增强标准的 FedAvg 算法，能够在不修改优化过程的情况下有效识别拜占庭客户端，证明了在多个场景中的稳定性和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Byzantine 去抵抗聚合机制计算量大，不适用于大规模和资源受限的联邦系统。TinyGuard 旨在提供一种轻量级的解决方案，以解决上述问题，通过统计更新指纹技术增强 FedAvg 算法来达到处理拜占庭客户端的目的。

Method: TinyGuard 通过提取紧凑的统计指纹来记录客户端更新的关键行为特征，如范数统计、层间比率、稀疏度测量和低阶矩，使用低维度指纹空间中的稳健统计偏差来检测拜占庭客户端，而不修改底层优化过程。

Result: 实验表明，TinyGuard 在善意场景下保持了 FedAvg 的收敛性，并在多个拜占庭攻击场景中达到了高达 95% 的准确率。分析表明攻击者无法同时逃避检测和实现有效的污染。此外，消融研究表明，TinyGuard 在不同的客户端数量和极大数据异质性下具有稳定的检测精度 (0.8)。

Conclusion: TinyGuard 提出的框架在不同数据模型上表现出高度的普适性，特别适用于基础模型的联邦微调，传统 Byzantine 防御在该场景中变得不切实际。

Abstract: Existing Byzantine robust aggregation mechanisms typically rely on fulldimensional gradi ent comparisons or pairwise distance computations, resulting in computational overhead that limits applicability in large scale and resource constrained federated systems. This paper proposes TinyGuard, a lightweight Byzantine defense that augments the standard FedAvg algorithm via statistical update f ingerprinting. Instead of operating directly on high-dimensional gradients, TinyGuard extracts compact statistical fingerprints cap turing key behavioral properties of client updates, including norm statistics, layer-wise ratios, sparsity measures, and low-order mo ments. Byzantine clients are identified by measuring robust sta tistical deviations in this low-dimensional fingerprint space with nd complexity, without modifying the underlying optimization procedure. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, ViT-Lite, and ViT-Small with LoRA adapters demonstrate that TinyGuard pre serves FedAvg convergence in benign settings and achieves up to 95 percent accuracy under multiple Byzantine attack scenarios, including sign-flipping, scaling, noise injection, and label poisoning. Against adaptive white-box adversaries, Pareto frontier analysis across four orders of magnitude confirms that attackers cannot simultaneously evade detection and achieve effective poisoning, features we term statistical handcuffs. Ablation studies validate stable detection precision 0.8 across varying client counts (50-150), threshold parameters and extreme data heterogeneity . The proposed framework is architecture-agnostic and well-suited for federated fine-tuning of foundation models where traditional Byzantine defenses become impractical

Result: 实验结果表明，TBFL框架可以完全缓解分布式标识符和可验证凭证导致的Sybil攻击，同时保持了较高的预测性能（AUC = 0.954，召回率 = 0.890），并且计算开销较小（不到0.12%）。此外，跨机构合作的数据共享成本低，且对机构的数量 robust。

Conclusion: 综上所述，本文提出的方法可以为医疗数据协作提供一个安全、可扩展且经济的有效生态系统。

Abstract: The digitization of healthcare has generated massive volumes of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), offering unprecedented opportunities for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA have created data silos that prevent centralized training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. Despite its potential, FL remains vulnerable to poisoning and Sybil attacks, in which malicious participants corrupt the global model or infiltrate the network using fake identities. While recent approaches integrate Blockchain technology for auditability, they predominantly rely on probabilistic reputation systems rather than robust cryptographic identity verification. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning (TBFL) framework integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our architecture ensures only authenticated healthcare entities contribute to the global model. Through comprehensive evaluation using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we demonstrate that anchoring trust in cryptographic identity verification rather than behavioral patterns significantly mitigates security risks while maintaining clinical utility. Our results show the framework successfully neutralizes 100% of Sybil attacks, achieves robust predictive performance (AUC = 0.954, Recall = 0.890), and introduces negligible computational overhead (<0.12%). The approach provides a secure, scalable, and economically viable ecosystem for inter-institutional health data collaboration, with total operational costs of approximately $18 for 100 training rounds across multiple institutions.

Motivation: 文章指出，随着AI技术的发展，尤其是生成式AI工具的普及和使用，传统的基于URL的防御机制显得越来越脆弱。为了适应这些新的威胁，文章旨在评估大语言模型如何在零样本和少量样本提示下提高钓鱼URL检测的效果。

Method: 使用了一个平衡的数据集，并通过一致的提示进行评估，对多种大语言模型进行了零样本和少量样本的检测实验，评估了它们的性能、泛化能力和实际效用。

Result: 研究结果显示，少量样本提示相比零样本提示在多个大语言模型上表现更好，提高了钓鱼URL的识别率。

Conclusion: 文章认为，基于少量样本的提示框架可以作为当前钓鱼URL检测系统的一种适应性解决方案，提升了检测性能并在实际应用中具有优势。

Abstract: The Uniform Resource Locator (URL), introduced in a connectivity-first era to define access and locate resources, remains historically limited, lacking future-proof mechanisms for security, trust, or resilience against fraud and abuse, despite the introduction of reactive protections like HTTPS during the cybersecurity era. In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs. Our evaluation uses a balanced dataset with consistent prompts, offering detailed analysis of performance, generalization, and model efficacy, quantified by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC, to reflect both classification quality and practical utility in threat detection settings. We conclude few-shot prompting improves performance across multiple LLMs.

Abstract: Many Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications require strong privacy guarantees for both users and their data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation directly on encrypted messages and thus offers a compelling approach to privacy-preserving data processing in ITS. However, practical HE schemes incur substantial ciphertext expansion and communication overhead, which limits their suitability for time-critical transportation systems. Hybrid homomorphic encryption (HHE) addresses this challenge by combining a homomorphic encryption scheme with a symmetric cipher, enabling efficient encrypted computation while dramatically reducing communication cost. In this paper, we develop theoretical models of representative ITS applications that integrate HHE to protect sensitive vehicular data. We then perform a parameter-based evaluation of the HHE scheme Rubato to estimate ciphertext sizes and communication overhead under realistic ITS workloads. Our results show that HHE achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in ciphertext size compared with conventional HE while maintaining cryptographic security, making it significantly more practical for latency-constrained ITS communication.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When creating public data products out of confidential datasets, inferential/posterior-based privacy definitions, such as Pufferfish, provide compelling privacy semantics for data with correlations. However, such privacy definitions are rarely used in practice because they do not always compose. For example, it is possible to design algorithms for these privacy definitions that have no leakage when run once but reveal the entire dataset when run more than once. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions that must be added to ensure linear composition for Pufferfish mechanisms, hence avoiding such privacy collapse. These extra conditions turn out to be differential privacy-style inequalities, indicating that achieving both the interpretable semantics of Pufferfish for correlated data and composition benefits requires adopting differentially private mechanisms to Pufferfish. We show that such translation is possible through a concept called the $(a,b)$-influence curve, and many existing differentially private algorithms can be translated with our framework into a composable Pufferfish algorithm. We illustrate the benefit of our new framework by designing composable Pufferfish algorithms for Markov chains that significantly outperform prior work.

Abstract: Evaluating and improving the security capabilities of code agents requires high-quality, executable vulnerability tasks. However, existing works rely on costly, unscalable manual reproduction and suffer from outdated data distributions. To address these, we present CVE-Factory, the first multi-agent framework to achieve expert-level quality in automatically transforming sparse CVE metadata into fully executable agentic tasks. Cross-validation against human expert reproductions shows that CVE-Factory achieves 95\% solution correctness and 96\% environment fidelity, confirming its expert-level quality. It is also evaluated on the latest realistic vulnerabilities and achieves a 66.2\% verified success. This automation enables two downstream contributions. First, we construct LiveCVEBench, a continuously updated benchmark of 190 tasks spanning 14 languages and 153 repositories that captures emerging threats including AI-tooling vulnerabilities. Second, we synthesize over 1,000 executable training environments, the first large-scale scaling of agentic tasks in code security. Fine-tuned Qwen3-32B improves from 5.3\% to 35.8\% on LiveCVEBench, surpassing Claude 4.5 Sonnet, with gains generalizing to Terminal Bench (12.5\% to 31.3\%). We open-source CVE-Factory, LiveCVEBench, Abacus-cve (fine-tuned model), training dataset, and leaderboard. All resources are available at https://github.com/livecvebench/CVE-Factory .

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting for wireless device authentication. However, their practical deployment faces two major limitations: domain shift, where models trained in one environment struggle to generalize to others, and the black-box nature of DNNs, which limits interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates a group of variable-length two-dimensional (2D) shapelets with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to achieve efficient, interpretable, and generalizable RF fingerprinting. The 2D shapelets explicitly capture diverse local temporal patterns across the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components, providing compact and interpretable representations. Complementarily, the pre-trained LLM captures more long-range dependencies and global contextual information, enabling strong generalization with minimal training overhead. Moreover, our framework also supports prototype generation for few-shot inference, enhancing cross-domain performance without additional retraining. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets across various protocols and domains. The results show that our method achieves superior standard and few-shot performance across both source and unseen domains.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs) elevates supply-chain risk on third-party model hubs, where an adversary can implant backdoors into released checkpoints. Existing ViT backdoor attacks largely rely on poisoned-data training, while prior data-free attempts typically require synthetic-data fine-tuning or extra model components. This paper introduces Data-Free Logic-Gated Backdoor Attacks (DF-LoGiT), a truly data-free backdoor attack on ViTs via direct weight editing. DF-LoGiT exploits ViT's native multi-head architecture to realize a logic-gated compositional trigger, enabling a stealthy and effective backdoor. We validate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, showing that DF-LoGiT achieves near-100% attack success with negligible degradation in benign accuracy and remains robust against representative classical and ViT-specific defenses.

Abstract: Detecting whether a model has been poisoned is a longstanding problem in AI security. In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI agents that autonomously interact with external tools and environments show great promise across real-world applications. However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/leolee99/AgentDyn.

Abstract: Cyber insurance, which protects insured organizations against financial losses from cyberattacks and data breaches, can be difficult and expensive to obtain for many organizations. These difficulties stem from insurers difficulty in understanding and accurately assessing the risks that they are undertaking. Cybersecurity audits, which are already implemented in many organizations for compliance and other purposes, present a potential solution to this challenge. This paper provides a structured review and analysis of prior work in this area, analysis of the challenges and potential benefits that cyber audits provide and recommendations for the use of cyber audits to reduce cyber insurance costs and improve its availability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Business logic vulnerabilities have become one of the most damaging yet least understood classes of smart contract vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification.
  In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives.
  We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\mathcal{B}_{\infty}$, total delay $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\%$) while touching fewer than $2\%$ of spikes under $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.

Abstract: We present GuardReasoner-Omni, a reasoning-based guardrail model designed to moderate text, image, and video data. First, we construct a comprehensive training corpus comprising 148k samples spanning these three modalities. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage paradigm to incentivize the model to deliberate before making decisions: (1) conducting SFT to cold-start the model with explicit reasoning capabilities and structural adherence; and (2) performing RL, incorporating an error-driven exploration reward to incentivize deeper reasoning on hard samples. We release a suite of models scaled at 2B and 4B parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GuardReasoner-Omni achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines across various guardrail benchmarks. Notably, GuardReasoner-Omni (2B) significantly surpasses the runner-up by 5.3% F1 score.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption. We discuss the framework's alignment with regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, DSA) and its role in verification infrastructure that complements platform-level mechanisms.

TL;DR: 研究利用自我承认的技术债务(SATD)补充静态分析工具(SAT)的输出，以解决SAT的局限性，结果发现SATD能显著提升安全缺陷的识别和理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高静态分析工具在安全工程中的效果，研究者们探讨如何利用开发人员承认的技术债务来辅助安全分析。

Method: 本研究采用混合方法，包括分析带有SATD注释的安全漏洞数据集和在线调查72名安全从业者。

Result: 所有SAT工具共发现了135个安全相关的SATD实例中的114个，涵盖24个不同的常见错误类型（CWE），其中6个是SAT通常忽视或难以识别的类别。调查显示开发者常用SAT输出结合SATD见解，以更好地理解和根除安全缺陷根源，识别合适修正。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，编码的SATD可以作为一个有意义的补充。帮助弥补SAT的实际不足，提高安全缺陷识别和处理的有效性。

Abstract: Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种解释性概念漂移检测方法，并通过实验验证其有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: Malware detection and classification into families are critical tasks in cybersecurity, complicated by the continual evolution of malware to evade detection. This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash在安全基础设施即代码(IaC)开发中的能力，发现尽管指导性提示能提高安全代码嗅探和生成的检测率，但在实际项目中仍存在不足，需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型在安全IaC开发中的应用能力，识别现有技术的局限并探索其提升潜力。

Method: 研究使用Stack Overflow数据集和GitHub仓库作为测试平台，通过引导提示和一般提示两种方法评估模型的性能。

Result: 一般提示下，模型在Stack Overflow数据集上约检测到71%的安全代码嗅探，在GitHub上检测率则低于50%；但在引导提示下，检测率分别提高到78%和67%。对于安全代码生成，仅7%的代码安全，明确指示生成安全代码后GPT的表现提升了10个百分点，而Gemini的变化不大。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，虽然大模型在检测和生成安全代码方面有一定的潜力，但在实际项目状况下其效果有限，需要进一步研究和改进技术以提高其在安全IaC开发中的应用效果。

Abstract: We investigated the capabilities of GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash for secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) development. For security smell detection, on the Stack Overflow dataset, which primarily contains small, simplified code snippets, the models detected at least 71% of security smells when prompted to analyze code from a security perspective (general prompt). With a guided prompt (adding clear, step-by-step instructions), this increased to 78%.In GitHub repositories, which contain complete, real-world project scripts, a general prompt was less effective, leaving more than half of the smells undetected. However, with the guided prompt, the models uncovered at least 67% of the smells. For secure code generation, we prompted LLMs with 89 vulnerable synthetic scenarios and observed that only 7% of the generated scripts were secure. Adding an explicit instruction to generate secure code increased GPT secure output rate to 17%, while Gemini changed little (8%). These results highlight the need for further research to improve LLMs' capabilities in assisting developers with secure IaC development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为mopri的概念框架，旨在通过综合、可调整和用户中心的方法分析移动应用的行为，以保护用户信息自治权。该框架整合了各种分析工具，采用了静态和动态分析方法，支持结果丰富和报告功能，展示了全面且模块化的隐私分析方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会中的日常服务越来越多地依赖于移动应用，出现了用户参与性和隐私保护之间的冲突。为此，本文提出mopri框架，旨在帮助终端用户和执法机构验证和实施数据保护合规性。

Method: mopri框架综合使用了静态和动态分析方法，并针对现有的分析框架提出了改进。此外，开发了一个原型来提取权限和跟踪库，并利用稳健的方法进行动态流量记录和解密。

Result: 这个原型能够有效地提取权限和跟踪库，同时采用稳健的方法进行动态流量记录和解密。此外，它包括了增强分析结果可读性和可用性的功能。

Conclusion: mopri框架展示了全面且模块化的隐私分析方法的有效性，强调了根据不同移动应用生态系统的演变挑战进行持续适应的重要性。

Abstract: Everyday services of society increasingly rely on mobile applications, resulting in a conflicting situation between the possibility of participation on the one side and user privacy and digital freedom on the other. In order to protect users' rights to informational self-determination, regulatory approaches for the collection and processing of personal data have been developed, such as the EU's GDPR. However, inspecting the compliance of mobile apps with privacy regulations remains difficult. Thus, in order to enable end users and enforcement bodies to verify and enforce data protection compliance, we propose mopri, a conceptual framework designed for analyzing the behavior of mobile apps through a comprehensive, adaptable, and user-centered approach. Recognizing the gaps in existing frameworks, mopri serves as a foundation for integrating various analysis tools into a streamlined, modular pipeline that employs static and dynamic analysis methods. Building on this concept, a prototype has been developed which effectively extracts permissions and tracking libraries while employing robust methods for dynamic traffic recording and decryption. Additionally, it incorporates result enrichment and reporting features that enhance the clarity and usability of the analysis outcomes. The prototype showcases the feasibility of a holistic and modular approach to privacy analysis, emphasizing the importance of continuous adaptation to the evolving challenges presented by the mobile app ecosystem.
