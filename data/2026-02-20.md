  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前法医牙龄评估中存在的方法学异质性、数据表示的断裂性和临床、法医与法律信息系统之间的互操作性有限性，限制了透明度和可重复性。

Method: AIdentifyAGE ontology 通过整合司法环境、个体信息、法医检查数据、牙发育评估方法、影像学图像、统计参考研究和基于AI的估计方法，提供了一个标准化且语义连贯的框架。

Result: AIdentifyAGE ontology 将促进法医牙龄评估的一致性、透明性和可解释性，为法医和司法领域的决策支持系统奠定坚实基础。

Conclusion: 通过AIdentifyAGE ontology，将提升法医牙龄评估的质量和可靠性，有助于促进不同领域之间的信息共享和互操作性。

Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

### [2] [Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716)
*Song-Ju Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过引入共享内部状态和干预的概念，证明了任何经典模型都必须有无法完全通过内部状态来调节的上下文依赖信息论代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单态重用在经典概率表示中的必然性，揭示上下文依赖性对于智能系统的重要性，以解决传统智能模型中的表示局限。

Method: 通过证明任何经典模型在重现上下文结果统计数据时，必须引入不可约的信息论代价，证明上下文依赖性是单态重用的固有结果。

Result: 提出了一种最小化构造性示例，明确了这种成本的操作意义，并解释了非经典概率框架通过放松全局联合概率空间的假设来避免这种障碍的方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，上下文约束作为适应性智能的一般表示约束，与物理实现无关，提出了一种新视角，重新定义了在智能系统设计中的上下文处理原则。

Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

### [3] [Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16727)
*Hua Yan,Heng Tan,Yingxue Zhang,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobCache 设计了一种利用重建缓存来实现大规模人类移动仿真效率提升的方法，通过编码推理步骤为潜在空间嵌入，并使用潜在空间评估器来重用和重组推理步骤，同时使用轻量级解码器将潜在空间推理链翻译为自然语言，从而提高仿真效率并保持与先进的人工智能方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模人类移动仿真对于城市规划、流行病学和交通分析等应用至关重要。然而，现有使用大型语言模型（LLM）的方法因其高计算成本而难以实现大规模仿真。因此，设计MobCache的目标是通过利用重建缓存来提高仿真的效率。

Method: MobCache 方法包括两个主要组件：一个推理组件，将每个推理步骤编码为潜在空间嵌入，并使用潜在空间评估器来重用和重组推理步骤；一个解码组件，使用受限于移动定律的轻量级解码器将潜在空间推理链转化为自然语言。

Result: 实验表明，MobCache 在多个维度上显著提高了效率，同时保持与最先进的基于LLM的方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: MobCache 框架为大规模人类移动仿真问题提供了一个有效的解决方案，展示了在保持仿真实性能的情况下提高仿真效率的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

TL;DR: 研究分析了60个大型语言模型(Large Language Model, LLM)基准，发现几乎一半的基准已饱和，且饱和率随基准年龄增长而增加。研究还发现，专家策划的基准不容易饱和，而私有数据的使用也未能有效防止饱和。

Motivation: 研究旨在分析和理解大型语言模型基准的饱和现象，以指导和改进未来的模型开发和评估，确保评价的有效性。

Method: 研究选取了60个LLM基准，从主要模型开发者的技术报告中获取，并根据任务设计、数据构建和评估格式等14个特性的不同进行了分类，测试了关于饱和因素的五个假设。

Result: 研究结果表明，几乎一半的基准已表现出饱和现象，且饱和率随基准年龄增加而上升。此外，发现隐藏测试数据（公有 vs 私有）对防止饱和没有显著效果，而由专家策划的基准比由众包策划的基准更能抗拒饱和。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了哪些设计选择可以延长基准的寿命，并为未来的持续评估提供了策略建议。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文通过构造8个超平面来分割10维超立方体改进了S(n)的上界，并使用CPro1工具提高构造效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者探讨了超平面如何切割n维超立方体的边，旨在提供一个更优的上界来评估所需超平面的数量。

Method: 论文首先分析了如何用超平面切割不同维度的超立方体，引入了CPro1工具来辅助构建最优构造，并通过优化参数得到更优的结果。

Result: 研究者证明了当n不是5的奇数倍时，S(n) ≤ ⌈4n/5⌉；n为5的奇数倍时，S(n) ≤ 4n/5 +1。此外，还获得了用k<n个超平面可以切割的最大边数的新下界。

Conclusion: CPro1工具帮助简化了搜索过程，提高了构造最优超平面集的有效性，整体上提升了对n维超立方体边切割的研究水平。

Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k<n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.

Abstract: Large-scale facilities increasingly face analysis and reporting latency as the limiting step in scientific throughput, particularly for structurally and magnetically complex samples that require iterative reduction, integration, refinement, and validation. To improve time-to-result and analysis efficiency, NeuDiff Agent is introduced as a governed, tool-using AI workflow for TOPAZ at the Spallation Neutron Source that takes instrument data products through reduction, integration, refinement, and validation to a validated crystal structure and a publication-ready CIF. NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay. Performance is assessed using a fixed prompt protocol and repeated end-to-end runs with two large language model backends, with user and machine time partitioned and intervention burden and recovery behaviors quantified under gating. In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts. These results establish a practical route to deploy agentic AI in facility crystallography while preserving traceability and publication-facing validation requirements.

Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective

Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.

Abstract: The paper introduces GUI-Owl-1.5, the latest native GUI agent model that features instruct/thinking variants in multiple sizes (2B/4B/8B/32B/235B) and supports a range of platforms (desktop, mobile, browser, and more) to enable cloud-edge collaboration and real-time interaction. GUI-Owl-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results on more than 20+ GUI benchmarks on open-source models: (1) on GUI automation tasks, it obtains 56.5 on OSWorld, 71.6 on AndroidWorld, and 48.4 on WebArena; (2) on grounding tasks, it obtains 80.3 on ScreenSpotPro; (3) on tool-calling tasks, it obtains 47.6 on OSWorld-MCP, and 46.8 on MobileWorld; (4) on memory and knowledge tasks, it obtains 75.5 on GUI-Knowledge Bench. GUI-Owl-1.5 incorporates several key innovations: (1) Hybird Data Flywheel: we construct the data pipeline for UI understanding and trajectory generation based on a combination of simulated environments and cloud-based sandbox environments, in order to improve the efficiency and quality of data collection. (2) Unified Enhancement of Agent Capabilities: we use a unified thought-synthesis pipeline to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, while placing particular emphasis on improving key agent abilities, including Tool/MCP use, memory and multi-agent adaptation; (3) Multi-platform Environment RL Scaling: We propose a new environment RL algorithm, MRPO, to address the challenges of multi-platform conflicts and the low training efficiency of long-horizon tasks. The GUI-Owl-1.5 models are open-sourced, and an online cloud-sandbox demo is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed in long-horizon, complex environments to solve challenging problems, but this expansion exposes them to long-horizon attacks that exploit multi-turn user-agent-environment interactions to achieve objectives infeasible in single-turn settings. To measure agent vulnerabilities to such risks, we present AgentLAB, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating LLM agent susceptibility to adaptive, long-horizon attacks. Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats. We anticipate that AgentLAB will serve as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings. The benchmark is publicly available at https://tanqiujiang.github.io/AgentLAB_main.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have scaled, safety guardrails remain largely stateless, treating multi-turn dialogues as a series of disconnected events. This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly answer queries by citing web sources, but existing evaluations emphasize answer correctness rather than evidence quality. We introduce SourceBench, a benchmark for measuring the quality of cited web sources across 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. SourceBench uses an eight-metric framework covering content quality (content relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (e.g., freshness, authority/accountability, clarity), and includes a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments closely. We evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources using SourceBench and conduct further experiments to understand the evaluation results. Overall, our work reveals four key new insights that can guide future research in the direction of GenAI and web search.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.

Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.

Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.

Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.

Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach. The full generated Lean code from our runs is available at https://github.com/optsuite/ReasBook.git.

Abstract: Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can answer sales-leader questions over live, customized CRM data, but most available models do not expose transparent, repeatable evidence of quality. This paper describes the Sales Research Agent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, an AI-first application that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and produces decision-ready insights through text and chart outputs. To make quality observable, we introduce the Sales Research Bench, a purpose-built benchmark that scores systems on eight customer-weighted dimensions, including text and chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, and chart quality. In a 200-question run on a customized enterprise schema on October 19, 2025, the Sales Research Agent outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 by 13 points and ChatGPT-5 by 24.1 points on the 100-point composite score, giving customers a repeatable way to compare AI solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \emph{single} policy network, causing \emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents often run for many steps while re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each turn. This increases cost, agent derailment probability, latency, and tool-selection errors. We propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG variant that retrieves, per step, only the minimal system-prompt fragments and the smallest necessary subset of tools. ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents. We detail the method, evaluation protocol, ablations, and operational guidance for practical deployment.

Abstract: Computer-use agents operate over long horizons under noisy perception, multi-window contexts, evolving environment states. Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks. These results highlight that system-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process. Our code and dataset can be found at project page: $\href{https://aidaslab.github.io/RFEval/}{https://aidaslab.github.io/RFEval/}$

Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/hyeon1996/S2Q.

Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models has led to the emergence of AI coding agents that autonomously create pull requests on GitHub. However, how these agents differ in their pull request description characteristics, and how human reviewers respond to them, remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset. We analyze agent differences in pull request description characteristics, including structural features, and examine human reviewer response in terms of review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes. We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates. These findings highlight the role of pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics in human-AI collaborative software development.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As 6G wireless systems evolve, growing functional complexity and diverse service demands are driving a shift from rule-based control to intent-driven autonomous intelligence. User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.
  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.
  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.

Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.

Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

Abstract: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.

Abstract: As the need for more accurate and powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) increases, so too does the size, execution time, memory footprint, and power consumption. To overcome this, solutions such as pruning have been proposed with their own metrics and methodologies, or criteria, for how weights should be removed. These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions. We show the capacity of these criterion functions and the framework on VGG inspired models, pruning up to 79\% of filters while retaining or improving accuracy, and reducing the computations needed by the network by up to 68\%.

Conclusion: JEPA-DNA 提供了一种新的预训练框架，为基因组基础模型提供了更稳健和基于生物学的表示，从而更好地理解基因组的功能逻辑。

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating complex environments requires agents to internalize the underlying logic of their world, yet standard world modelling methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability. We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.

*Ben Yellin,Ehud Ezra,Mark Foreman,Shula Grinapol*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Large Behavioral Model (LBM)，这是一种通过条件概率丰富的人格特征谱来预测个体战略选择的大型行为基础模型。与基于提示的方法相比，LBM在保持人格特征的准确性方面表现出色，并且随着提供更详细的人格维度，LBM的预测能力逐步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在高风险环境中的决策预测是一个重大挑战，现有模型往往无法准确预测个体在特定情境下的行为，尤其是当人的心理特质和环境约束交织影响决策时。LBM旨在解决这一问题，通过学习一个综合的心理特征谱来更好地模拟个体的行为。

Method: LBM通过利用高度结构化的高维度心理特征谱来改进行为预测过程，而不是使用带有提示的模型。它在定制的数据集上进行训练，该数据集将稳定的个性特征、动机状态和情境约束与观察到的选择联系起来。LBM通过配对不同维度的心理特征与离散行动，提高了复杂决策情境下的预测精度。

Result: LBM在预测个体行为方面表现得更好，与未适应的Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct基础模型相比，LBM在保留人格特征准确性的情况下显著提高了预测精度。此外，当使用大五人格特质作为条件时，LBM的性能与最先进的基准相当。研究还发现，与基于提示的方法相比，LBM可以从更丰富的心理维度中获益，从而改善预测准确性。

Conclusion: LBM为高保真行为模拟提供了一种可扩展的方法，为战略预见、谈判分析、认知安全和决策支持等应用场景开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的黑箱特性要求新的评估框架超越表面性能指标。由于这些模型在内部表示方式上缺乏透明度，学者们需要探索更深入的方法来评估其复杂认知任务的能力。

Method: 研究使用布卢姆分类法作为层次化视角，分析来自不同语言模型的高维激活向量，通过线性分类器评估不同认知水平（从基础回忆到抽象合成）的可区分性。

Result: 研究结果表明，语言模型的表示空间中存在一个线性可访问的子空间，可以实现约95%的准确率，区分所有布卢姆认知层次的任务。这表明认知难度在前向传播早期被模型解决策。

Conclusion: 研究结论支持大型语言模型能够编码不同的认知层次，并且这些层次在模型的表示中是线性可访问的，这为理解模型的认知处理机制提供了证据。

Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在已解决事件上的预测准确性需要避免它们利用训练期间获得的未来信息，因此提出了用于回溯评估的框架来检测和量化时间知识泄露。

Method: 该框架通过将模型推理分解为基本主张并按时间可验证性进行分类，然后使用Shapley值测量每个主张对预测的贡献，以此来衡量Shapley-加权决策关键泄露率。

Result: 实验结果显示标准提示基线存在大量泄露，TimeSPEC方法减少了泄露并保持了任务性能。

Conclusion: 研究证明，基于时间的监督预测结合提取主张的方法比基于提示的时间约束更有利于可靠回溯评估。

Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.

Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.

Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.

Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.

Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.

Abstract: Innovation in Recommender Systems is currently impeded by a fractured ecosystem, where researchers must choose between the ease of in-memory experimentation and the costly, complex rewriting required for distributed industrial engines. To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.

Abstract: The significant advancements in computational power cre- ate a vast opportunity for using Artificial Intelligence in different ap- plications of healthcare and medical science. A Hybrid FL-Enabled Ensemble Approach For Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging a Combination of SWIN Transformer and CNN is the combination of cutting-edge technology of AI and Federated Learning. Since, medi- cal specialists and hospitals will have shared data space, based on that data, with the help of Artificial Intelligence and integration of federated learning, we can introduce a secure and distributed system for medical data processing and create an efficient and reliable system. The proposed hybrid model enables the detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia based on x-ray reports. We will use advanced and the latest available tech- nology offered by Tensorflow and Keras along with Microsoft-developed Vision Transformer, that can help to fight against the pandemic that the world has to fight together as a united. We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.

Abstract: Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.

Abstract: Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.

Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.

Abstract: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究系统地评估了广泛使用的AI安全数据集的质量，在隔离和实践中发现这些数据集过度依赖于触发线索，而非真实世界中的恶意攻击特性。去除这些线索后，之前被认为是‘合理安全’的模型变得不安全，且意图漂白技术在完全黑盒访问下始终能取得超过90%的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示当前AI安全数据集评估方法与真实世界攻击行为之间的差距，通过全面的评估方法发现数据集的不足，以推动AI安全保障措施的发展。

Method: 研究采用了两种评估方法：一是孤立评估，从三个关键属性的角度检查数据集反应该现实攻击的能力；二是实践评估，通过一种名为‘意图漂白’的程序来去除杀伤链中的触发线索，探索数据集测量真实安全风险的能力。

Result: 结果显示当前广泛采用的AI安全数据集过度依赖于触发线索而非真实恶意攻击特征，这导致现有的评估方法未能准确反映现实中的攻击情况。去除触发线索后，之前被认为安全的模型变得不再安全，表明这些数据集的不足之处。

Conclusion: 研究者建议应重新设计AI安全数据集并改进评估流程，以更真实地反映和预防实际的攻击行为，从而提高模型的安全性。

Abstract: We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.

*Scott Thornton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 在代码审查中，对抗性评论对大型语言模型的检测准确性影响很小，即使使用复杂的欺骗策略。静态分析在检测漏洞方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗性评论是否会影响大型语言模型在代码审查中的漏洞检测能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含Python、JavaScript和Java的100样本基准，每个样本配有八种不同类型的评论，包括未注释代码和对抗性策略。评估了八个前沿模型在总计9,366次试验中的性能，并测试了四种自动化防御措施。

Result: 对抗性评论在所有模型中对检测准确性的影响都不大（精确McNemar检验p值大于0.21）。静态分析在补充检查中表现最佳，恢复了47%的基本错误，并在总计14,012次试验中实现了96.9%的检测率。

Conclusion: 对抗性评论未能显著影响代码审查中漏洞检测模型的表现，且静态分析是最有效的防御策略。

Abstract: AI-assisted code review is widely used to detect vulnerabilities before production release. Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.

TL;DR: 本文进行了全面的经验研究，评估了LLM排名器对逃脱提示攻击的脆弱性。研究涵盖了两种任务：偏好脆弱性评估和排名脆弱性评估，同时系统地检查了关键因素，并发现了不同架构的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在排名中表现出强大的再排名能力，但近期的研究表明，简单的提示注入可以在文档中显著改变LLM的排名决策，这构成了严重的安全风险。因此，研究这种漏洞对于确保LLM在实际应用中的安全性至关重要。

Method: 研究采用系统性地评估两种常用的评价指标：攻击成功率(ASR)和Norm Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG@10)。同时，研究覆盖了三种主要的排名范式（成对、列表和集合），以及两种注入变体（决策目标劫持和决策准则劫持），探讨了这一漏洞在不同模型家族、模型位置敏感性、基础架构和跨域鲁棒性方面的扩展。

Result: 该研究不仅重新确认了先前的研究发现，还扩展了分析以覆盖不同家族模型、位置敏感性、基础架构和跨域鲁棒性。研究结果界定了这些漏洞的边界条件，特别指出编码-解码架构表现出较强的自然抗劫持攻击能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解LLM在排名中的弱点提供重要见解，并公开发布了用于实验评估的方法和结果，为未来的研究和应用提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful re-rankers. Recent research has however showed that simple prompt injections embedded within a candidate document (i.e., jailbreak prompt attacks) can significantly alter an LLM's ranking decisions. While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks. We publicly release our code and additional experimental results at https://github.com/ielab/LLM-Ranker-Attack.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NESSiE 是一个轻量级的安全基准，用于检测大型语言模型在安全方面可能存在的漏洞。尽管最先进的模型在 NESSiE 上的表现不佳，但 NESSiE 仅作为安全部署的必要条件。Safe & Helpful (SH) 指标展示了模型更倾向于表现得有帮助而非安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型逐渐应用在关键领域，研究其潜在的安全风险是必要的。NESSiE 基准旨在揭示大型语言模型中未预料的安全问题，以促进模型安全性的提升。

Method: NESSiE 通过设计少量的信息和访问安全性测试用例来评估模型的安全性能。Safe & Helpful (SH) 指标通过比较模型在安全和帮助性方面的表现来提供直接的衡量标准。

Result: NESSiE 测试揭示了即使最先进的模型在简单安全任务上也存在不足，Safe & Helpful (SH) 指标展示了模型倾向于更易于用户交互而非绝对遵守安全原则。

Conclusion: NESSiE 并不完美，并不能完全保证安全，但它是一个必要的条件，使得任何部署前必须通过该项测试。研究结果强调了在自由环境中部署此类模型所面临的重大风险。NESSiE 数据集、工具包和绘图代码已公开提供。

Abstract: We introduce NESSiE, the NEceSsary SafEty benchmark for large language models (LLMs). With minimal test cases of information and access security, NESSiE reveals safety-relevant failures that should not exist, given the low complexity of the tasks. NESSiE is intended as a lightweight, easy-to-use sanity check for language model safety and, as such, is not sufficient for guaranteeing safety in general -- but we argue that passing this test is necessary for any deployment. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach 100% on NESSiE and thus fail our necessary condition of language model safety, even in the absence of adversarial attacks. Our Safe & Helpful (SH) metric allows for direct comparison of the two requirements, showing models are biased toward being helpful rather than safe. We further find that disabled reasoning for some models, but especially a benign distraction context degrade model performance. Overall, our results underscore the critical risks of deploying such models as autonomous agents in the wild. We make the dataset, package and plotting code publicly available.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究展示了大规模语言模型能够实现大范围的匿名用户重新识别，即便只有伪匿名的在线资料及对话内容。采用语言模型的方法，在不同的数据集上表现出了远优于传统方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网上的匿名交流越来越多，人们需要更好的方法来保障在线隐私。然而这项研究发现现有的匿名保护机制可能并不足够，大规模语言模型的出现使得用户身份更容易被重新识别。这要求我们重新考虑在线隐私的威胁模型。

Method: 研究设计了一种基于大规模语言模型的匿名用户重新识别框架：首先提取身份相关的特征，然后利用语义嵌入进行候选匹配，最后用逻辑推理验证并减少误匹配。该方法直接处理多个平台上的未结构化文本，无需依赖结构化的原始数据或人工特征工程。

Result: 该方法在三个不同数据集上的识别效果显著优于传统方法，最高能达到90%的精确率为68%的召回率，而非基于大语言模型的方法能在最好的情况下降recall到近于0。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明现有的保护在线匿名的措施难以持续保护匿名身份，现有的威胁模型需要重新评估。

Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.

TL;DR: NeST 是一种轻量级的安全对齐框架，通过选择性地调整与安全相关的少量神经元来增强拒绝行为，无需对整个模型进行大范围修改，从而实现有针对性且稳定的安全适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大规模语言模型（LLMs）安全对齐方法主要依赖于复杂的微调，而对于频繁更新或需适应新政策和领域的场景，这种方法存在难以快速可靠地更新安全策略的问题。NeST 框架解决了这些问题，通过结构感知的方式增强安全行为，确保模型的安全性。

Method: NeST 通过聚类功能一致的安全相关神经元，并在每个聚类内进行共享参数更新，无需对整个模型进行大范围的修改或在推理时增加额外的开销，从而实现了精确且稳定的模型安全适应。

Result: 与三个主要基准方法相比，NeST 在 10 个不同的大型语言模型上表现出更强大的安全性能。在所有评估的模型中，NeST 将攻击的成功率从平均 44.5% 降低到了 4.36%，相当于在不安全生成方面减少了 90.2%，同时只需要 0.44 百万训练参数，相对全微调减少了 17,310 倍，相比 LoRA 减少了 9.25 倍。

Conclusion: NeST 提出了一种新的轻量级、结构感知的安全对齐方法，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更加灵活和高效的模型安全更新，为大规模语言模型的安全部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for the responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.
  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average. This amounts to a 17,310x decrease in updated parameters compared to full fine-tuning and a 9.25x reduction relative to LoRA, while consistently achieving stronger safety performance for alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了通过利用隐私保护的大语言模型推理来提供推理结果保证的新方法，只需少量额外的计算成本且对后续性能影响极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的规模增长，用户难以在本地部署运行这些模型，更多地转而依赖第三方托管服务，但随之而来的是缺乏对推理服务计算的保证，比如提供商可能用运行成本更低、性能较差的模型替代，导致用户结果被误报等问题。

Method: 本文提出的方法是基于隐私保护的LLM推理来提供验证服务，不依赖于现有的需要大量计算开销的零知识证明等技术。通过将隐私保护的原则应用到验证过程中，本文提出了一种巧妙的技术。

Result: 作者提出的协议方法允许通过极少的额外计算（几令牌数量级）提供验证服务。与零知识证明方法相比，本文的方法提高了验证的运行时间。

Conclusion: 本文的工作提供了关于隐私与LLM推理验证之间联系的新见解，标志着在保证大模型推理准确性方面的一种进步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, fewer users are able to host and run models locally. This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime. Our work provides novel insights into the connections between privacy and verifiability in LLM inference.

Motivation: 当前的密码学安全性通常基于博弈论或模拟定义，本文旨在提出一种基于数学领域的新方法来表述安全性，以便为更复杂的加密抽象提供几何基础。

Method: 通过将攻击者观测模型为格罗滕迪克站点，使用覆盖家族表示由高效模拟决定的部分信息的可接受分解。协议传输被视为她aves，安全属性表现为几何条件。

Conclusion: 本文为理解模拟安全提供了概念上的解释，并为进一步的加密抽象提供了一个几何基础。

Abstract: Cryptographic security is traditionally formulated using game-based or simulation-based definitions. In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.
  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.
  As a first step, we focus on $Σ$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $Σ$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $Σ$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction.
  This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Fischlin transform yields non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs with straight-line extractability in the classical random oracle model. This is done by forcing a prover to generate multiple accepting transcripts through a proof-of-work mechanism. Whether the Fischlin transform is straight-line extractable against quantum adversaries has remained open due to the difficulty of reasoning about the likelihood of query transcripts in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM), even when using the compressed oracle methodology. In this work, we prove that the Fischlin transform remains straight-line extractable in the QROM, via an extractor based on the compressed oracle. This establishes the post-quantum security of the Fischlin transform, providing a post-quantum straight-line extractable NIZK alternative to Pass' transform with smaller proof size. Our techniques include tail bounds for sums of independent random variables and for martingales as well as symmetrization, query amplitude and quantum union bound arguments.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, service robots, and LLM-driven interactive agents) are rapidly transitioning from controlled environments to safety critical real-world deployments. Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.

Abstract: In current inter-organizational data spaces, usage policies are enforced mainly at the asset level: a whole document or dataset is either shared or withheld. When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.

Abstract: We present Jolt Atlas, a zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) framework that extends the Jolt proving system to model inference. Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.
  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.
  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \textit{AI memory}).

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) implementations are notoriously prone to errors, with subtle bugs frequently invalidating theoretical guarantees. Existing verification methods are often impractical: formal tools are too restrictive, while black-box statistical auditing is intractable for complex pipelines and fails to pinpoint the source of the bug. This paper introduces Re:cord-play, a gray-box auditing paradigm that inspects the internal state of DP algorithms. By running an instrumented algorithm on neighboring datasets with identical randomness, Re:cord-play directly checks for data-dependent control flow and provides concrete falsification of sensitivity violations by comparing declared sensitivity against the empirically measured distance between internal inputs. We generalize this to Re:cord-play-sample, a full statistical audit that isolates and tests each component, including untrusted ones. We show that our novel testing approach is both effective and necessary by auditing 12 open-source libraries, including SmartNoise SDK, Opacus, and Diffprivlib, and uncovering 13 privacy violations that impact their theoretical guarantees. We release our framework as an open-source Python package, thereby making it easy for DP developers to integrate effective, computationally inexpensive, and seamless privacy testing as part of their software development lifecycle.

Abstract: Despite the high volume of open-source Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), our understanding of long-term threat actor-victim dynamics remains fragmented due to the lack of structured datasets and inconsistent reporting standards. In this paper, we present a large-scale automated analysis of open-source CTI reports spanning two decades. We develop a high-precision, LLM-based pipeline to ingest and structure 13,308 reports, extracting key entities such as attributed threat actors, motivations, victims, reporting vendors, and technical indicators (IoCs and TTPs). Our analysis quantifies the evolution of CTI information density and specialization, characterizing patterns that relate specific threat actors to motivations and victim profiles. Furthermore, we perform a meta-analysis of the CTI industry itself. We identify a fragmented ecosystem of distinct silos where vendors demonstrate significant geographic and sectoral reporting biases. Our marginal coverage analysis reveals that intelligence overlap between vendors is typically low: while a few core providers may offer broad situational awareness, additional sources yield diminishing returns. Overall, our findings characterize the structural biases inherent in the CTI ecosystem, enabling practitioners and researchers to better evaluate the completeness of their intelligence sources.

Abstract: Coin selection refers to the problem of choosing a set of tokens to fund a transaction in token-based payment systems such as, e.g., cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In this paper, we propose the Boltzmann Draw that is a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the principles of statistical physics. The algorithm relies on drawing tokens according to the Boltzmann distribution, serving as an extension and improvement of the Random Draw method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bounding the number of selected input tokens as well as reducing dust generation and limiting the token pool size in the wallet. Moreover, the probabilistic algorithm can be implemented efficiently, improves performance and respects privacy requirements - properties of significant relevance for current token-based technologies. We compare the Boltzmann draw to both the standard Random Draw and the Greedy algorithm. We argue that the former is superior to the latter in the sense of the above objectives. Our findings are relevant for token-based technologies, and are also of interest for CBDCs, which as a legal tender possibly needs to handle large transaction volumes at a high frequency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents show promise for automating penetration testing, yet reported performance varies widely across systems and benchmarks. We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains.
  Based on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems. These results show that difficulty-aware planning yields consistent end-to-end gains across models and addresses a limitation that model scaling alone does not eliminate.

Abstract: A recent breakthrough [Hirahara and Nanashima, STOC'2024] established that if $\mathsf{NP} \not \subseteq \mathsf{ioP/poly}$, the existence of zero-knowledge with negligible errors for $\mathsf{NP}$ implies the existence of one-way functions (OWFs). In this work, we obtain a characterization of one-way functions from the worst-case complexity of zero-knowledge {\em in the high-error regime}.
  We say that a zero-knowledge argument is {\em non-trivial} if the sum of its completeness, soundness and zero-knowledge errors is bounded away from $1$. Our results are as follows, assuming $\mathsf{NP} \not \subseteq \mathsf{ioP/poly}$:
  1. {\em Non-trivial} Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK) arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$ imply the existence of OWFs. Using known amplification techniques, this result also provides an unconditional transformation from weak to standard NIZK proofs for all meaningful error parameters.
  2. We also generalize to the interactive setting: {\em Non-trivial} constant-round public-coin zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$ imply the existence of OWFs, and therefore also (standard) four-message zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$.
  Prior to this work, one-way functions could be obtained from NIZKs that had constant zero-knowledge error $ε_{zk}$ and soundness error $ε_{s}$ satisfying $ε_{zk} + \sqrt{ε_{s}} < 1$ [Chakraborty, Hulett and Khurana, CRYPTO'2025]. However, the regime where $ε_{zk} + \sqrt{ε_{s}} \geq 1$ remained open. This work closes the gap, and obtains new implications in the interactive setting. Our results and techniques could be useful stepping stones in the quest to construct one-way functions from worst-case hardness.
