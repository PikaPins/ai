Prior work on backdoor attacks has largely focused on a black-box threat model, with an adversary targeting the model builder's LLM. However, in the bias manipulation setting, the model builder themselves could be the adversary, warranting a white-box threat model where the attacker's ability to poison, and manipulate the poisoned data is substantially increased. Furthermore, despite growing research in semantically-triggered backdoors, most studies have limited themselves to syntactically-triggered attacks. Motivated by these limitations, we conduct an analysis consisting of over 1000 evaluations using higher poisoning ratios and greater data augmentation to gain a better understanding of the potential of syntactically- and semantically-triggered backdoor attacks in a white-box setting. In addition, we study whether two representative defense paradigms, model-intrinsic and model-extrinsic backdoor removal, are able to mitigate these attacks. Our analysis reveals numerous new findings. We discover that while both syntactically- and semantically-triggered attacks can effectively induce the target behaviour, and largely preserve utility, semantically-triggered attacks are generally more effective in inducing negative biases, while both backdoor types struggle with causing positive biases. Furthermore, while both defense types are able to mitigate these backdoors, they either result in a substantial drop in utility, or require high computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u767d\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u6613\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u95e8\u7c7b\u578b\u90fd\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6b63\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u8f7b\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u4eba\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc71000\u6b21\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6bd4\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u6613\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6b63\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u8f7b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u8f83\u96be\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u514d\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

This new issuance paradigm has led to a surge in high-risk token launches, causing substantial financial losses for unsuspecting buyers. In this paper, we introduce MemeTrans, the first dataset for studying and detecting high-risk memecoin launches on Solana. MemeTrans covers over 40k memecoin launches that successfully migrated to the public Decentralized Exchange (DEX), with over 30 million transactions during the initial sale on launchpad and 180 million transactions after migration. To precisely capture launch patterns, we design 122 features spanning dimensions such as context, trading activity, holding concentration, and time-series dynamics, supplemented with bundle-level data that reveals multiple accounts controlled by the same entity. Finally, we introduce an annotation approach to label the risk level of memecoin launches, which combines statistical indicators with a manipulation-pattern detector. Experiments on the introduced high-risk launch detection task suggest that designed features are informative for capturing high-risk patterns and ML models trained on MemeTrans can effectively reduce financial loss by 56.1%.

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), federated fine-tuning of generative LLMs has gained attention as a way to leverage distributed data while preserving confidentiality. However, this setting introduces fundamental challenges: (i) privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) due to LLM memorization, and (ii) a persistent tension between global generalization and local utility under heterogeneous data. Existing defenses, such as data sanitization and differential privacy, reduce leakage but often degrade downstream performance. We propose SecureGate, a privacy-aware federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs that provides fine-grained privacy control without sacrificing utility. SecureGate employs a dual-adapter LoRA architecture: a secure adapter that learns sanitized, globally shareable representations, and a revealing adapter that captures sensitive, organization-specific knowledge. A token-controlled gating module selectively activates these adapters at inference time, enabling controlled information disclosure without retraining. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that SecureGate improves task utility while substantially reducing PII leakage, achieving up to a 31.66X reduction in inference attack accuracy and a 17.07X reduction in extraction recall for unauthorized requests.

Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6BotzoneBench\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5316\u5230\u6280\u80fd\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6e38\u620fAI\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6280\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u57df\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u5df2\u5b9a\u4e49\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u5bf9\u6218\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u77ac\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u951a\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Botzone\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5316\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6e38\u620fAI\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BotzoneBench\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6e38\u620fAI\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6218\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although the dataset watermark technique holds promise for auditing and verifying usage, existing methods are hindered by inconsistent evaluations, which impede fair comparisons and assessments of real-world viability. To address this gap, we propose a two-layer taxonomy that categorizes methods by implementation (model-based vs. model-free injection; model-behavior vs. model-message verification), offering a structured framework for cross-task analysis. Then, we develop DWBench, a unified benchmark and open-source toolkit for systematically evaluating image dataset watermark techniques in classification and generation tasks.\n  Using DWBench, we assess 25 representative methods under standardized conditions, perturbation-based robustness tests, multi-watermark coexistence, and multi-user interference. In addition to reporting the results of four commonly used metrics, we present the results of two new metrics: sample significance for fine-grained watermark distinguishability and verification success rate for dataset-level auditing, which enable accurate and reproducible benchmarking. Key findings reveal inherent trade-offs: no single method dominates all scenarios; classification and generation tasks require specialized approaches; and existing techniques exhibit instability at low watermark rates and in realistic multi-user settings, with elevated false positives or performance declines. We hope that DWBench can facilitate advances in watermark reliability and practicality, thus strengthening copyright safeguards in the face of widespread AI-driven data exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6DWBench\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8625\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4f4e\u6c34\u5370\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6DWBench\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u7c7b\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DWBench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002DWBench\u5305\u62ec25\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u591a\u6c34\u5370\u5171\u5b58\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7DWBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8625\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4f4e\u6c34\u5370\u7387\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u548cDWBench\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u5f3a\u9762\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

We present AISA, a lightweight, single-pass defense that activates safety behaviors already latent inside the model rather than treating safety as an add-on. AISA first localizes intrinsic safety awareness via spatiotemporal analysis and shows that intent-discriminative signals are broadly encoded, with especially strong separability appearing in the scaled dot-product outputs of specific attention heads near the final structural tokens before generation. Using a compact set of automatically selected heads, AISA extracts an interpretable prompt-risk score with minimal overhead, achieving detector-level performance competitive with strong proprietary baselines on small (7B) models. AISA then performs logits-level steering: it modulates the decoding distribution in proportion to the inferred risk, ranging from normal generation for benign prompts to calibrated refusal for high-risk requests -- without changing model parameters, adding auxiliary modules, or requiring multi-pass inference. Extensive experiments spanning 13 datasets, 12 LLMs, and 14 baselines demonstrate that AISA improves robustness and transfer while preserving utility and reducing false refusals, enabling safer deployment even for weakly aligned or intentionally risky model variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "AISA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u89c6\u4e3a\u9644\u52a0\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u3002AISA \u8fd8\u6267\u884c\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u62d2\u7edd\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5e38\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u62a4\u680f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u3002AISA\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "AISA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e2d\u610f\u56fe\u533a\u5206\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee4\u724c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u70b9\u79ef\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7591\u4f3c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0cAISA\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u5730\u62d2\u7edd\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8bf7\u6c42\u5219\u6b63\u5e38\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "result": "AISA\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\uff087B\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001LLM\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cAISA\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u865a\u5047\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "conclusion": "AISA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u5f31\u6216\u6545\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.\n  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.\n  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity.

For safety alignment, the core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off between safety and utility. However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning.

Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains over the seed baseline at matched training steps, improving SynLogic by +5.2, BBEH by +1.4, AIME25 by +3.0, and Brumo25 by +3.7.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSLogic \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5143\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u4fee\u590d\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ece\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u589e\u957f\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002SSLogic \u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "SSLogic \u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u4fee\u590d\u5faa\u73af\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u53cd\u590d\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol \u7684\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u76f2\u5ba1\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u90a3\u4e9b\u542b\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\u6216\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u4ece 400 \u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e24\u8f6e\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86 953 \u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c 21,389 \u4e2a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08\u4ece 5,718 \u4e2a\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf SSLogic \u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e0e\u79cd\u5b50\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSynLogic \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 5.2%\uff0cBBEH \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 1.4%\uff0cAIME25 \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 3.0%\uff0cBrumo25 \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 3.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "SSLogic \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior.

We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce AlignSentinel, a three-class classifier that leverages features derived from LLM's attention maps to categorize inputs accordingly. To support evaluation, we construct the first systematic benchmark containing inputs from all three categories.

The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Published at the 23rd International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS 2024)", "summary": "Location information extracted from mobile devices has been largely exploited to reveal our routines, significant places, and interests just to name a few. Given the sensitivity of the information it reveals, location access is protected by mobile operating systems and users have control over which applications can access it. We argue that applications can still infer the coarse-grain location information by using alternative sensors that are available in off-the-shelf mobile devices that do not require any permissions from the users. In this paper we present a zero-permission attack based on the use of the in-built magnetometer, considering a variety of methods for identifying location-types from their magnetic signature. We implement the proposed approach by using four different techniques for time-series classification. In order to evaluate the approach, we conduct an in-the-wild study to collect a dataset of nearly 70 hours of magnetometer readings with six different phones at 66 locations, each accompanied by a label that classifies it as belonging to one of six selected categories. Finally, using this dataset, we quantify the performance of all models based on two evaluation criteria: (i) leave-a-place-out (using the test data collected from an unknown place), and (ii) leave-a-device-out (using the test data collected from an unknown device) showing that we are able to achieve 40.5% and 39.5% accuracy in classifying the location-type for each evaluation criteria respectively against a random baseline of approximately 16.7% for both of them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u624b\u673a\u5185\u7f6e\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7528\u6237\u8bb8\u53ef\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91ce\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u624b\u673a\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u975e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6743\u9650\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u5730\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7528\u6237\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u7684\u8fd170\u5c0f\u65f6\u3001\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u624b\u673a\u572866\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u8bfb\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5730\u70b9\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a40.5%\u548c39.5%\uff0c\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea62.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

While post-training methods have shown promise in general coding tasks, their systematic application to VD remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the post-training pipeline for LLM-based VD, spanning from cold-start SFT to off-policy preference optimization and on-policy RL, uncovering how data curation, stage interactions, reward mechanisms, and evaluation protocols collectively dictate the efficacy of model training and assessment. Our study identifies practical guidelines and insights: (1) SFT based on rejection sampling greatly outperforms rationalization-based supervision, which can introduce hallucinations due to ground-truth leakage. (2) While increased SFT epochs constantly benefit preference optimization, excessive SFT inhibits self-exploration during RL, ultimately limiting performance gains. (3) Coarse-grained reward signals often mislead RL, whereas fine-grained root-cause judgments ensure reliable credit assignment. Specification-based rewards offer further benefits but incur significant effort in specification generation.

Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.", "AI": {"tldr": "NL2LOGIC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9012\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cNL2LOGIC\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNL2LOGIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u903b\u8f91\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "NL2LOGIC\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee5\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u8d1f\u8d23\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5219\u6839\u636e\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u751f\u6210\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u903b\u8f91\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728FOLIO\u3001LogicNLI\u548cProofWriter\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cNL2LOGIC\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8699%\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630%\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06NL2LOGIC\u96c6\u6210\u5230Logic-LM\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8631%\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7Logic-LM\u539f\u6709\u7684\u672a\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "NL2LOGIC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Until recently, the implementation of security measures in DevOps environments was often considered optional by many government entities and critical national services operating in the cloud. This includes systems managing sensitive information, such as electoral processes or military operations, which have historically been valuable targets for cybercriminals. Resistance to security implementation is often driven by concerns over losing agility in software development, increasing the risk of accumulated vulnerabilities. Nowadays, patching software is no longer enough; adopting a proactive cyber defense strategy, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is crucial to anticipating and mitigating threats. Thus, this work proposes integrating the Security Chaos Engineering (SCE) methodology with a new LLM-based flow to automate the creation of attack defense trees that represent adversary behavior and facilitate the construction of SCE experiments based on these graphical models, enabling teams to stay one step ahead of attackers and implement previously unconsidered defenses.

Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.\n  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.\n  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains.

With CSA, we are not simply seeking a passive point of view, but rather informed decision-making that allows us to improve response times and monitor the consequences and effects an attack has on one of our elements and how it will affect other elements it interacts with.

This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution.

However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party. Model providers secret-share model weights, and users secret-share inputs, ensuring that each server operates only on random shares. While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols.

Flow theory suggests that when job demands misalign with practitioner capabilities, work becomes overwhelming or tedious rather than engaging. Achieving challenge-skill balance begins at hiring: if job descriptions inaccurately portray requirements, organizations risk recruiting underskilled practitioners who face anxiety or overskilled ones who experience boredom. Yet we lack empirical understanding of what current SOC job descriptions actually specify. We analyzed 106 public SOC job postings from November to December 2024 across 35 organizations in 11 countries, covering Analysts (n=17), Incident Responders (n=38), Threat Hunters (n=39), and SOC Managers (n=12). Using Inductive Content Analysis, we coded certifications, technical skills, soft skills, tasks, and experience requirements. Three patterns emerged: (1) Communication skills dominate (50.9% of postings), exceeding SIEM tools (18.9%) or programming (30.2%), suggesting organizations prioritize collaboration over technical capabilities. (2) Certification expectations vary widely: CISSP leads (22.6%), but 43 distinct credentials appear with no universal standard. (3) Technical requirements show consensus: Python dominates programming (27.4%), Splunk leads SIEM platforms (14.2%), and ISO 27001 (13.2%) and NIST (10.4%) are most cited standards. These findings enable organizations to audit job descriptions against empirical baselines, help practitioners identify valued certifications and skills, and allow researchers to validate whether stated requirements align with actual demands.

To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision.

However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment.

Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue.

We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness.

Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x.

However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success.

Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Human Experts Matter More Than Other LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9075\u5faa\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u90a3\u4e9b\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u4f1a\u5bf9\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u5176\u4ed6LLM\u6216\u670b\u53cb\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u610f\u89c1\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u81ea\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002\u5f53\u6709\u5206\u6b67\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9075\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u503e\u5411\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features.

We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction.

However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning.

But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \\textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \\emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \\textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\\footnote{\\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (\u0394) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-\u03a9(\u0394/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon).

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance.

Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability.

Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms.

Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost.

Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores.

Stadie"], "title": "Evolutionary System Prompt Learning can Facilitate Reinforcement Learning for LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.\n  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.\n  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.\n  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5c16\u7aef\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u6838\u5371\u673a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03AI\u6a21\u62df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u903b\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c16\u7aef\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6838\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u4e3a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684AI\u6218\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u573a\u6838\u5371\u673a\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e09\u6b3e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u7acb\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5371\u673a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u627f\u8bfa\u3001\u5347\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bef\u5224\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51faAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5982\u5e76\u4e0d\u56e0\u6838\u7981\u5fcc\u800c\u907f\u514d\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u6838\u6218\u7565\u6027\u8fdb\u653b\u5e76\u4e0d\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u5f80\u5f80\u5f15\u53d1\u53cd\u5347\u7ea7\u800c\u975e\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fe1\u8a89\u53cd\u800c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7edd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u59a5\u534f\u6216\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u66b4\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86AI\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u6218\u7565\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u8b66\u793a\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6218\u7565\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7531AI\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6218\u7565\u60c5\u5883\u3002"}}

Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable.

We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints.

While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered.

While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test.
