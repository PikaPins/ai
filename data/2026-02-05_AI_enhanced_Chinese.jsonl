However, Ethereum's current block-building ecosystem, MEV-Boost, has become highly centralized due to integration, which distorts competition, reduces blockspace efficiency, and obscures MEV flow transparency. To guarantee equitability and economic efficiency in block building, we propose $\\mathrm{Boost+}$, a system that decouples the process into collecting and ordering transactions, and ensures equal access to all collected transactions.\n  The core of $\\mathrm{Boost+}$ is the mechanism $\\mathit{M}_{\\mathrm{Boost+}}$, built around a default algorithm. $\\mathit{M}_{\\mathrm{Boost+}}$ aligns incentives for both searchers (intermediaries that generate or route transactions) and builders: Truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for all builders. For searchers, truthful reporting is dominant whenever the default algorithm dominates competing builders, and it remains dominant for all conflict-free transactions, even when builders may win. We further show that even if a searcher can technically integrate with a builder, non-integration combined with truthful bidding still dominates any deviation for conflict-free transactions.

In the blockchain domain, developers increasingly rely on LLMs to generate and maintain smart contracts, the immutable, self-executing components of decentralized applications. Because deployed smart contracts cannot be modified, correctness and security are paramount, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance and governance. Despite this growing reliance, the security implications of LLM-generated smart contracts remain insufficiently understood.\n  In this work, we conduct a systematic security analysis of Solidity smart contracts generated by state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Sonnet. We evaluate these contracts against a broad set of known smart contract vulnerabilities to assess their suitability for direct deployment in production environments. Our extensive experimental study shows that, despite their syntactic correctness and functional completeness, LLM-generated smart contracts frequently exhibit severe security flaws that could be exploited in real-world settings. We further analyze and categorize these vulnerabilities, identifying recurring weakness patterns across different models. Finally, we discuss practical countermeasures and development guidelines to help mitigate these risks, offering actionable insights for both developers and researchers. Our findings aim to support safe integration of LLMs into smart contract development workflows and to strengthen the overall security of the blockchain ecosystem against future security failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684Solidity\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9632\u8303\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5c06LLMs\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9009\u62e9\u4e86ChatGPT\u3001Gemini\u548cSonnet\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u751f\u6210\u7684Solidity\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f31\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7TMK\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "TMK\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86TMK\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728PlanBench\u7684Blocksworld\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTMK\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e4b\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8697.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3aTMK\u4e0d\u4f46\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5176\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5230\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eTMK\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u586b\u8865\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus.

Under review", "summary": "We prove the conjecture stated in Appendix F.3 of [Zhu et al. (2022)]: among all conversion rules that map a R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy (RDP) profile $\u03c4\\mapsto \u03c1(\u03c4)$ to a valid hypothesis-testing trade-off $f$, the rule based on the intersection of single-order RDP privacy regions is optimal. This optimality holds simultaneously for all valid RDP profiles and for all Type I error levels $\u03b1$. Concretely, we show that in the space of trade-off functions, the tightest possible bound is $f_{\u03c1(\\cdot)}(\u03b1) = \\sup_{\u03c4\\geq 0.5} f_{\u03c4,\u03c1(\u03c4)}(\u03b1)$: the pointwise maximum of the single-order bounds for each RDP privacy region. Our proof unifies and sharpens the insights of [Balle et al. (2019)], [Asoodeh et al. (2021)], and [Zhu et al. (2022)]. Our analysis relies on a precise geometric characterization of the RDP privacy region, leveraging its convexity and the fact that its boundary is determined exclusively by Bernoulli mechanisms. Our results establish that the \"intersection-of-RDP-privacy-regions\" rule is not only valid, but optimal: no other black-box conversion can uniformly dominate it in the Blackwell sense, marking the fundamental limit of what can be inferred about a mechanism's privacy solely from its RDP guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Zhu\u7b49\u4eba(2022)\u4e2d\u9644\u5f55F.3\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u731c\u60f3\uff1a\u6240\u6709\u5c06R\u00e9nyi\u5dee\u5f02\u9690\u79c1(RDP)\u914d\u7f6e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6709\u6548\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6743\u8861\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d,\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u9636RDP\u9690\u79c1\u533a\u57df\u4ea4\u96c6\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6709\u6548\u7684RDP\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u7684I\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u6c34\u5e73\u03b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u8be5\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u597d\u5730\u5c06RDP\u914d\u7f6e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5316RDP\u9690\u79c1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4ec5\u7531\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u673a\u5236\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u2018\u4ea4\u96c6\u7684RDP\u9690\u79c1\u533a\u57df\u2019\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u9ed1\u76d2\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u5747\u5300\u5360\u636e\u5b83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u9636RDP\u9690\u79c1\u533a\u57df\u4ea4\u96c6\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6709\u6548\u7684RDP\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u578bI\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u6c34\u5e73\u03b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u9636RDP\u9690\u79c1\u533a\u57df\u7684\u70b9wise\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u9636RDP\u9690\u79c1\u533a\u57df\u4ea4\u96c6\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u7684RDP\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u65ad\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002"}}

One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines.

We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative.

Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a \"free gift\" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty.

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u653b\u51fb\uff08AEAs\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u6301\u6709\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4fe1\u4efbAI\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u5851\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u653b\u51fb\uff08AEAs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08n = 205\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6c9f\u901a\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6765\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8861\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u65e0\u5bb3\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u53d1\u751f\u5728AEAs\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u6743\u5a01\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u8bed\u6c14\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9632\u8303\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.\n  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u5957\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7f6e\u4e8e\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u4e3b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7684\u516c\u7406\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9650\u4e8e\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u7406\u96c6\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.\n  On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Interfaze \u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5f02\u6784 DNN \u548c\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u9884\u9009\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5c42\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684 DNN \u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406 OCR\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u8d1f\u8d23\u4ece\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001PDF \u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u6765\u6e90\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u884c\u52a8\u5c42\u80fd\u591f\u6d4f\u89c8\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9876\u5c42\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Interfaze \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5353\u8d8a\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 MMLU-Pro \u5f97\u5206 83.6%\uff0cMMLU \u5f97\u5206 91.4%\uff0cGPQA-Diamond 81.3%\uff0cLiveCodeBench v5 57.8%\uff0cAIME-2025 90.0%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728 MMMU\u3001AI2D\u3001ChartQA \u548c Common Voice v16 \u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u5206\u6570\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5ea6\u63d0\u70bc\u8fc7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Interfaze \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u9020\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5b83\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u8bf8\u5982\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aScalable Interactive Oversight\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u9012\u5f52\u6811\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6536\u96c6\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u7684\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ece\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u6811\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u6536\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u9012\u5f52\u5730\u805a\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8654%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u6301\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728AI\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy.

Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation.

Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario.

Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.\n  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVibe AIGC\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u5408\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u591aAgent\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u610f\u56fe-\u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u518d\u53ea\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a'\u6c1b\u56f4'\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u636e\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6613\u7528\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u6392\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u6784\u60f3\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8f\u89c2\u7684\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\uff08Vibe\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u5212\u5e08\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u591aAgent\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u671b\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u4ece\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u5f15\u64ce\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u66f4\u5177\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u4e45\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u521b\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Vibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8f\u89c2\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u6392\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aWideSeek-R1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e7f\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5e76\u884c\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u9762\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "WideSeek-R1\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9886\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWideSeek-R1-4B\u5728WideSearch\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u9879\u76eeF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a40.0%\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684DeepSeek-R1-671B\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5e76\u884c\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cWideSeek-R1-4B\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5e7f\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002WideSeek-R1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cQwQ-32B\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u62bd\u8c61\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u62bd\u8c61\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790QwQ-32B\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u8be6\u5c3d\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Mystery Blocksworld\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5QwQ-32B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u6ce8\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\uff09\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cQwQ-32B\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u7cca\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u592a\u591a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u793a\uff09\u6765\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u6709\u6240\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}}
