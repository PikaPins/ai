Abstract: Distributed storage architectures are foundational to modern cloud-native infrastructure, yet a critical operational bottleneck persists within disaster recovery (DR) workflows: the dependence on content-based cryptographic hashing for data identification and synchronization. While hash-based deduplication is effective for storage efficiency in steady-state operation, it becomes a systemic liability during failover and failback events when hash indexes are stale, incomplete, or must be rebuilt following a crash. This paper precisely characterizes the operational conditions under which full or partial re-hashing becomes unavoidable. The paper also analyzes the downstream impact of cryptographic re-hashing on Recovery Time Objective (RTO) compliance, and proposes a generalized architectural shift toward deterministic, metadata-driven identification. The proposed framework assigns globally unique composite identifiers to data blocks at ingestion time-independent of content analysis enabling instantaneous delta computation during DR without any cryptographic overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in real-world systems. Given their broader applicability, prompt engineering has become an efficient tool for resource-scarce organizations to adopt LLMs for their own purposes. At the same time, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Thus, analyzing this risk has become a critical security requirement. This work evaluates prompt-injection and jailbreak vulnerability using a large, manually curated dataset across multiple open-source LLMs, including Phi, Mistral, DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.2, Qwen, and Gemma variants. We observe significant behavioural variation across models, including refusal responses and complete silent non-responsiveness triggered by internal safety mechanisms. Furthermore, we evaluated several lightweight, inference-time defence mechanisms that operate as filters without any retraining or GPU-intensive fine-tuning. Although these defences mitigate straightforward attacks, they are consistently bypassed by long, reasoning-heavy prompts.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to their autoregressive counterparts. Yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show that well-established data-poisoning pipelines can successfully implant backdoors into MDLMs, enabling attackers to manipulate model behavior via specific triggers while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. However, defense strategies effective to these models are yet to emerge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a backdoor defense framework for MDLMs named DiSP (Diffusion Self-Purification). DiSP is driven by a key observation: selectively masking certain vision tokens at inference time can neutralize a backdoored model's trigger-induced behaviors and restore normal functionality. Building on this, we purify the poisoned dataset using the compromised model itself, then fine-tune the model on the purified data to recover it to a clean one. Given such a specific design, DiSP can remove backdoors without requiring any auxiliary models or clean reference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates backdoor effects, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) from over 90% to typically under 5%, while maintaining model performance on benign tasks.

Abstract: The current generation of large language models produces sophisticated social-engineering content that bypasses standard text screening systems in business communication platforms. Our proposed solution for mail gateway and endpoint deception detection operates in a privacy-protective manner while handling the performance requirements of network and mobile security systems. The MobileBERT teacher receives fine-tuning before its transformation into a BiLSTM model with multi-head attention which maintains semantic discrimination only with 4.5 million parameters. The hybrid dataset contains human-written messages together with LLM-generated paraphrases that use masking techniques and personalization methods to enhance modern attack resistance. The evaluation system uses five testing protocols which include human-only and LLM-only tests and two cross-distribution transfer tests and a production-like mixed traffic test to assess performance in native environments and across different distribution types and combined traffic scenarios. The distilled model maintains a weighted-F1 score difference of 1-2.5 points compared to the mixture split results of strong transformer baselines including ModernBERT, DeBERTaV3-base, T5-base, DeepSeek-R1 Distill Qwen-1.5B and Phi-4 mini while achieving 80-95\% faster inference times and 95-99\% smaller model sizes. The system demonstrates excellent performance in terms of accuracy and latency while maintaining a compact size which enables real-time filtering without acceleration hardware and supports policy-based management. The paper examines system performance under high traffic conditions and security measures for privacy protection and implementation methods for operational deployment.

Abstract: Training-data poisoning attacks can induce targeted, undetectable failure in deep neural networks by corrupting a vanishingly small fraction of training labels. We demonstrate this on acoustic vehicle classification using the MELAUDIS urban intersection dataset (approx. 9,600 audio clips, 6 classes): a compact 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on log-mel spectrograms achieves 95.7% Attack Success Rate (ASR) -- the fraction of target-class test samples misclassified under the attack -- on a Truck-to-Car label-flipping attack at just p=0.5% corruption (48 records), with zero detectable change in aggregate accuracy (87.6% baseline; 95% CI: 88-100%, n=3 seeds). We prove this stealth is structural: the maximum accuracy drop from a complete targeted attack is bounded above by the minority class fraction (beta). For real-world class imbalances (Truck approx. 3%), this bound falls below training-run noise, making aggregate accuracy monitoring provably insufficient regardless of architecture or attack method. A companion backdoor trigger attack reveals a novel trigger-dominance collapse: when the target class is a dataset minority, the spectrogram patch trigger becomes functionally redundant--clean ASR equals triggered ASR, and the attack degenerates to pure label flipping. We formalize the ML training pipeline as an attack surface and propose a trust-minimized defense combining content-addressed artifact hashing, Merkle-tree dataset commitment, and post-quantum digital signatures (ML-DSA-65/CRYSTALS-Dilithium3, NIST FIPS 204) for cryptographically verifiable data provenance.

Abstract: Data privacy is important in the AI era, and differential privacy (DP) is one of the golden solutions. However, DP is typically applicable only if data have a bounded underlying distribution. We address this limitation by leveraging second-moment information from a small amount of public data. We propose Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT), which transforms private data using the public second-moment matrix and applies a principled truncation whose radius depends only on non-private quantities: data dimension and sample size. This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions. Specifically, we design new loss functions and algorithms, ensuring that solutions in the transformed space can be mapped back to the original domain. We have established improvements in the models' DP estimation through theoretical error bounds, robustness guarantees, and convergence results, attributing the gains to the conditioning effect of PMT. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that PMT substantially improves the accuracy and stability of DP models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential to contemporary AI applications, allowing large language models to obtain external knowledge via vector similarity search. Nevertheless, these systems encounter a significant security flaw: hubness - items that frequently appear in the top-k retrieval results for a disproportionately high number of varied queries. These hubs can be exploited to introduce harmful content, alter search rankings, bypass content filtering, and decrease system performance.
  We introduce hubscan, an open-source security scanner that evaluates vector indices and embeddings to identify hubs in RAG systems. Hubscan presents a multi-detector architecture that integrates: (1) robust statistical hubness detection utilizing median/MAD-based z-scores, (2) cluster spread analysis to assess cross-cluster retrieval patterns, (3) stability testing under query perturbations, and (4) domain-aware and modality-aware detection for category-specific and cross-modal attacks. Our solution accommodates several vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) and offers versatile retrieval techniques, including vector similarity, hybrid search, and lexical matching with reranking capabilities.
  We evaluate hubscan on Food-101, MS-COCO, and FiQA adversarial hubness benchmarks constructed using state-of-the-art gradient-optimized and centroid-based hub generation methods. hubscan achieves 90% recall at a 0.2% alert budget and 100% recall at 0.4%, with adversarial hubs ranking above the 99.8th percentile. Domain-scoped scanning recovers 100% of targeted attacks that evade global detection. Production validation on 1M real web documents from MS MARCO demonstrates significant score separation between clean documents and adversarial content. Our work provides a practical, extensible framework for detecting hubness threats in production RAG systems.

Abstract: Modern infrastructures rely on software systems that remain vulnerable to cyberattacks. These attacks frequently exploit vulnerabilities documented in repositories such as MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). However, Cyber Threat Intelligence resources, including MITRE ATT&CK and CVE, provide only partial coverage of attack-vulnerability relationships. Attack information often appears before vulnerabilities are formally linked, creating the need for automated methods that infer likely vulnerabilities directly from attack descriptions.
  This thesis addresses the problem of predicting known vulnerabilities from natural-language descriptions of cyberattacks. We develop transformer-based sentence embedding methods that encode attack and vulnerability descriptions into semantic vector representations, enabling similarity-based ranking and recommendation.
  Fourteen state-of-the-art transformer models were evaluated across four attack description types (Tactic, Technique, Procedure, and Attack Pattern). Results show that Technique descriptions in MITRE ATT&CK provide the strongest predictive signal. The multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieved the best performance due to its hybrid pre-training and optimization for semantic similarity.
  The approach was implemented in the VULDAT tool, which automatically links attacks to vulnerabilities. Manual validation revealed previously undocumented relationships in MITRE repositories. Evaluation on unseen cyberattack reports demonstrates that the models generalize beyond curated datasets and support proactive vulnerability awareness.

Abstract: Markov chains model a wide range of user behaviors. However, generating accurate Markov chain models requires substantial user data, and sharing these models without privacy protections may reveal sensitive information about the underlying user data. We introduce a method for protecting user data used to formulate a Markov chain model. First, we develop a method for privatizing database queries whose outputs are elements of the unit simplex, and we prove that this method is differentially private. We quantify its accuracy by bounding the expected KL divergence between private and non-private queries. We extend this method to privatize stochastic matrices whose rows are each a simplex-valued query of a database, which includes data-driven Markov chain models. To assess their accuracy, we analytically bound the change in the stationary distribution and the change in the convergence rate between a non-private Markov chain model and its private form. Simulations show that under a typical privacy implementation, our method yields less than 2% error in the stationary distribution, indicating that our approach to private modeling faithfully captures the behavior of the systems we study.

Abstract: Agentic large language model systems increasingly automate tasks by retrieving URLs and calling external tools. We show that this workflow gives rise to implicit prompt injection: adversarial instructions embedded in automatically generated URL previews, including titles, metadata, and snippets, can introduce a system-level risk that we refer to as silent egress. Using a fully local and reproducible testbed, we demonstrate that a malicious web page can induce an agent to issue outbound requests that exfiltrate sensitive runtime context, even when the final response shown to the user appears harmless. In 480 experimental runs with a qwen2.5:7b-based agent, the attack succeeds with high probability (P (egress) =0.89), and 95% of successful attacks are not detected by output-based safety checks. We also introduce sharded exfiltration, where sensitive information is split across multiple requests to avoid detection. This strategy reduces single-request leakage metrics by 73% (Leak@1) and bypasses simple data loss prevention mechanisms. Our ablation results indicate that defenses applied at the prompt layer offer limited protection, while controls at the system and network layers, such as domain allowlisting and redirect-chain analysis, are considerably more effective. These findings suggest that network egress should be treated as a first-class security outcome in agentic LLM systems. We outline architectural directions, including provenance tracking and capability isolation, that go beyond prompt-level hardening.

Abstract: Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks threaten the availability of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, particularly under resource-constrained deployment conditions. Although transfer learning models have shown promising detection accuracy, their reliability, computational feasibility, and interpretability in operational environments remain insufficiently explored. This study presents an explainability-aware empirical evaluation of seven pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures for multi-class IoT DDoS detection using the CICDDoS2019 dataset and an image-based traffic representation. The analysis integrates performance metrics, reliability-oriented statistics (MCC, Youden Index, confidence intervals), latency and training cost assessment, and interpretability evaluation using Grad-CAM and SHAP. Results indicate that DenseNet and MobileNet-based architectures achieve strong detection performance while demonstrating superior reliability and compact, class-consistent attribution patterns. DenseNet169 offers the strongest reliability and interpretability alignment, whereas MobileNetV3 provides an effective latency-accuracy trade-off for fog-level deployment. The findings emphasize the importance of combining performance, reliability, and explainability criteria when selecting deep learning models for IoT DDoS detection.

Abstract: Edge deployment of LLM agents on IoT hardware introduces attack surfaces absent from cloud-hosted orchestration. We present an empirical security analysis of three architectures (cloud-hosted, edge-local swarm, and hybrid) using a multi-device home-automation testbed with local MQTT messaging and an Android smartphone as an edge inference node. We identify five systems-level attack surfaces, including two emergent failures observed during live testbed operation: coordination-state divergence and induced trust erosion. We frame core security properties as measurable systems metrics: data egress volume, failover window exposure, sovereignty boundary integrity, and provenance chain completeness. Our measurements show that edge-local deployments eliminate routine cloud data exposure but silently degrade sovereignty when fallback mechanisms trigger, with boundary crossings invisible at the application layer. Provenance chains remain complete under cooperative operation yet are trivially bypassed without cryptographic enforcement. Failover windows create transient blind spots exploitable for unauthorised actuation. These results demonstrate that deployment architecture, not just model or prompt design, is a primary determinant of security risk in agent-controlled IoT systems.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that machine unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) fails to generalize across languages: knowledge erased in one language frequently remains accessible through others. However, the underlying cause of this failure and a principled solution remain open. In this work, we identify intervention depth as the key factor determining multilingual generalization. Through systematic layer-wise experiments, we characterize two distinct failure modes: shallow-layer interventions achieve erasure but collapse multilingual capabilities in held-out languages, while deep-layer interventions preserve utility but fail to erase target knowledge even in source languages. These findings reveal that the choice of intervention layer is not a free parameter; it fundamentally determines whether multilingual unlearning succeeds. We propose MUTE (Multilingual Unlearning via Targeted Erasure), a framework that uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Linguistic Regions Development Score (LRDS) to identify intermediate, language-agnostic layers where cross-lingual representations converge. By restricting unlearning updates to these layers, MUTE achieves robust multilingual knowledge erasure while optimizing on only a small set of source languages. Extensive experiments across three LLM architectures and three unlearning algorithms validate our approach, with mechanistic analysis via Logit Lens probing confirming genuine knowledge removal rather than output-level suppression.

Abstract: SQL is the de facto interface for exploratory data analysis; however, releasing exact query results can expose sensitive information through membership or attribute inference attacks. Differential privacy (DP) provides rigorous privacy guarantees, but in practice, DP alone may not satisfy governance requirements such as the \emph{minimum frequency rule}, which requires each released group (cell) to include contributions from at least $k$ distinct individuals. In this paper, we present \textbf{DPSQL+}, a privacy-preserving SQL library that simultaneously enforces user-level $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP and the minimum frequency rule. DPSQL+ adopts a modular architecture consisting of: (i) a \emph{Validator} that statically restricts queries to a DP-safe subset of SQL; (ii) an \emph{Accountant} that consistently tracks cumulative privacy loss across multiple queries; and (iii) a \emph{Backend} that interfaces with various database engines, ensuring portability and extensibility. Experiments on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that DPSQL+ achieves practical accuracy across a wide range of analytical workloads -- from basic aggregates to quadratic statistics and join operations -- and allows substantially more queries under a fixed global privacy budget than prior libraries in our evaluation.

Abstract: Commercial large language models are typically deployed as black-box API services, requiring users to trust providers to execute inference correctly and report token usage honestly. We present IMMACULATE, a practical auditing framework that detects economically motivated deviations-such as model substitution, quantization abuse, and token overbilling-without trusted hardware or access to model internals. IMMACULATE selectively audits a small fraction of requests using verifiable computation, achieving strong detection guarantees while amortizing cryptographic overhead. Experiments on dense and MoE models show that IMMACULATE reliably distinguishes benign and malicious executions with under 1% throughput overhead. Our code is published at https://github.com/guo-yanpei/Immaculate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools and retrieval systems to autonomously complete complex tasks. However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover. It localizes takeover points via controlled counterfactual re-executions at tool-return boundaries and enables safe continuation through causally guided context purification that removes attack-induced deviations while preserving task-relevant evidence. We evaluate AgentSentry on the \textsc{AgentDojo} benchmark across four task suites, three IPI attack families, and multiple black-box LLMs. AgentSentry eliminates successful attacks and maintains strong utility under attack, achieving an average Utility Under Attack (UA) of 74.55 %, improving UA by 20.8 to 33.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines without degrading benign performance.

Abstract: Each year, software vulnerabilities are discovered, which pose significant risks of exploitation and system compromise. We present a convolutional neural network model that can successfully identify bugs in C code. We trained our model using two complementary datasets: a machine-labeled dataset created by Draper Labs using three static analyzers and the NIST SATE Juliet human-labeled dataset designed for testing static analyzers. In contrast with the work of Russell et al. on these datasets, we focus on C programs, enabling us to specialize and optimize our detection techniques for this language. After removing duplicates from the dataset, we tokenize the input into 91 token categories. The category values are converted to a binary vector to save memory. Our first convolution layer is chosen so that the entire encoding of the token is presented to the filter. We use two convolution and pooling layers followed by two fully connected layers to classify programs into either a common weakness enumeration category or as ``clean.'' We obtain higher recall than prior work by Russell et al. on this dataset when requiring high precision. We also demonstrate on a custom Linux kernel dataset that we are able to find real vulnerabilities in complex code with a low false-positive rate.

Abstract: In open Federated Learning (FL) environments where no central authority exists, ensuring collaboration fairness relies on decentralized reward settlement, yet the prohibitive cost of permissionless blockchains directly clashes with the high-frequency, iterative nature of model training. Existing solutions either compromise decentralization or suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to linear on-chain costs. To address this, we present SettleFL, a trustless and scalable reward settlement protocol designed to minimize total economic friction by offering a family of two interoperable protocols. Leveraging a shared domain-specific circuit architecture, SettleFL offers two interoperable strategies: (1) a Commit-and-Challenge variant that minimizes on-chain costs via optimistic execution and dispute-driven arbitration, and (2) a Commit-with-Proof variant that guarantees instant finality through per-round validity proofs. This design allows the protocol to flexibly adapt to varying latency and cost constraints while enforcing rational robustness without trusted coordination. We conduct extensive experiments combining real FL workloads and controlled simulations. Results show that SettleFL remains practical when scaling to 800 participants, achieving substantially lower gas cost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a foundational cryptographic protocol that ensures information-theoretic security. However, classical protocols such as BB84, though favored for their simplicity, offer limited resistance to eavesdropping, and perform poorly under realistic noise conditions. Recent research has explored the use of discrete-time Quantum Walks (QWs) to enhance QKD schemes. In this work, we specifically focus on a one-way QKD protocol, where security depends exclusively on the underlying Quantum Walk (QW) topology, rather than the details of the protocol itself. Our paper introduces a novel protocol based on QWs over a hypercube topology and demonstrates that, under identical parameters, it provides significantly enhanced security and noise resistance compared to the circular topology (i.e., state-of-the-art), thereby strengthening protection against eavesdropping. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient and extensible simulation framework for one-way QKD protocols based on QWs, supporting both circular and hypercube topologies. Implemented with IBM's software development kit for quantum computing (i.e., Qiskit), our toolkit enables noise-aware analysis under realistic noise models. To support reproducibility and future developments, we release our entire simulation framework as open-source. This contribution establishes a foundation for the design of topology-aware QKD protocols that combine enhanced noise tolerance with topologically driven security.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.

Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC)数据集，用于研究人类在抽象推理方面的策略。该数据集源自Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)，并通过两实验评估了260名参与者的表现。研究发现，即使在错误的解决方案中，参与者也表现出高度的收敛性，但由于任务难度和解题策略的不同，准确性会有所变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在抽象推理中的策略，特别是在从少量示例中快速学习和应用规则的能力。

Method: 使用CogARC数据集，该数据集源自ARC并编制了75个抽象视觉推理问题，参与者自由生成解决方案。记录了参与者的高时间分辨率行为数据，包括示例查看、编辑序列和多次尝试提交。

Result: 参与者总体表现良好（实验1平均准确率~90%，实验2平均准确率~80%），但不同问题和参与者的表现出较大差异。更难的问题导致更长的思考时间和更大的解题策略多样性。参与者在任务期间日益熟悉任务结构，而不是提高了规则学习能力。重要的是，即使在错误的解决方案中，参与者也表现出高度的收敛性。

Conclusion: CogARC是一个丰富的认知环境，用于研究人类的抽象推理，提供了解释人们如何在不确定性中泛化、误泛化和调整策略的见解。

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了潜在推理方法中的两个关键问题，并提出了潜在推理监督对模型性能影响的权衡关系。

Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.

Abstract: Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\% to +8.3\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.

Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.

Abstract: To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

Abstract: Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable "safety valve". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.
  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models. By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms. The code accompanying this paper is available at~ \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/Taesar}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from "Know What You Know" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

Abstract: Clinical decisions are often required under incomplete information. Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence truly contribute to creative mathematical research, or does it merely automate routine calculations while introducing risks of error? We provide empirical evidence through a detailed case study: the discovery of novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules via systematic human-AI collaboration.
  Working with multiple AI assistants, we extended results beyond what manual work achieved, formulating and proving several theorems with AI assistance. The collaboration revealed both remarkable capabilities and critical limitations. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, systematic proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation. However, every step required rigorous human verification, mathematical intuition for problem formulation, and strategic direction.
  We document the complete research workflow with unusual transparency, revealing patterns in successful human-AI mathematical collaboration and identifying failure modes researchers must anticipate. Our experience suggests that, when used with appropriate skepticism and verification protocols, AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery while demanding careful human oversight and deep domain expertise.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) diagnoses students' concept mastery through continuous learning state monitoring in education.Existing methods primarily focus on studying behavioral sequences based on ID or textual information.While existing methods rely on ID-based sequences or shallow textual features, they often fail to capture (1) the hierarchical evolution of cognitive states and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

Abstract: Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.

Abstract: The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

AIQI performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions, instead of policies or environments like previous works. Under a grain of truth condition, we prove that AIQI is strong asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal and asymptotically $\varepsilon$-Bayes-optimal. Our results significantly expand the diversity of known universal agents.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

Abstract: Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.
