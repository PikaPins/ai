It is essential for privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and financial data analysis. In popular HE schemes, ciphertext multiplication is only defined for two inputs. However, the multiplication of multiple inputs is needed in many HE applications. In our previous work, a three-input ciphertext multiplication method for the CKKS HE scheme was developed. This paper first reformulates the three-input ciphertext multiplication to enable the combination of computations in order to further reduce the complexity. The second contribution is extending the multiplication to multiple inputs without compromising the noise overhead. Additional evaluation keys are introduced to achieve relinearization of polynomial multiplication results. To minimize the complexity of the large number of rescaling units in the multiplier, a theoretical analysis is developed to relocate the rescaling, and a multi-level rescaling approach is proposed to implement combined rescaling with complexity similar to that of a single rescaling unit. Guidelines and examples are provided on the input partition to enable the combination of more rescaling. Additionally, efficient hardware architectures are designed to implement our proposed multipliers. The improved three-input ciphertext multiplier reduces the logic area and latency by 15% and 50%, respectively, compared to the best prior design. For multipliers with more inputs, ranging from 4 to 12, the architectural analysis reveals 32% savings in area and 45% shorter latency, on average, compared to prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e58\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u4e58\u6cd5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e58\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e58\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e09\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8615%\u548c50%\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e4\u523012\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c1132%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c1145%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To ensure fast and safe charging, complex communication is required between the vehicle and the charging station. In the globally used Combined Charging System (CCS), this communication is carried over the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) physical layer. However, HPGP is known to suffer from wireless leakage, which may expose this data link to nearby attackers.\n  In this paper, we examine active wireless attacks against CCS, and study the impact they can have. We present the first real-time Software-Defined Radio (SDR) implementation of HPGP, granting unprecedented access to the communications within the charging cables. We analyze the characteristics of 2,750 real-world charging sessions to understand the timing constraints for hijacking. Using novel techniques to increase the attacks' reliability, we design a robust wireless Man-in-the-Middle evaluation framework for CCS.\n  We demonstrate full control over TLS usage and CCS protocol version negotiation, including TLS stripping attacks. We investigate how real devices respond to safety-critical MitM attacks, which modify power delivery information, and found target vehicles to be highly permissive. First, we caused a vehicle to display charging power exceeding 900 kW on the dashboard, while receiving only 40 kW. Second, we remotely overcharged a vehicle, at twice the requested current for 17 seconds before the vehicle triggered the emergency shutdown.

To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace.

A virtualized environment usually deploys a virtual switch within the host system to enable virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the physical network. The Open vSwitch (OVS) is one of the most popular software-based virtual switches. It maintains a cache hierarchy to accelerate packet forwarding from the host to virtual machines. We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches.

We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%.

However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies. Our work reveals significant security gaps and highlights the pressing need for stronger safeguards for RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAGCRAWLER \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u914d\u968f\u673a\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff08ASCP\uff09\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u8fb9\u7f18\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6536\u76ca\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cdRAG\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e RAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u5f0f\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "RAGCRAWLER \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u8fb9\u7f18\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f30\u7b97\u503c\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89c4\u5212\u65b0\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5c1a\u672a\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "RAGCRAWLER \u5728\u591a\u4e2a RAG \u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe 84.4% \u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8 20.7%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RAGCRAWLER \u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 RAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9 RAG \u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep \"academic value\", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys.

Although feature selection is commonly employed to mitigate these issues, many existing approaches lack robustness when applied to large-scale and heterogeneous malware data. To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation. Additional analyses demonstrate low inter-feature redundancy and improved interpretability through SHAP-based explanations. Runtime and memory profiling further indicate reduced downstream classification overhead. Overall, CAFE-GB provides a stable, interpretable, and scalable feature selection strategy for large-scale malware detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Unsurprisingly, fuzz testing firmware is an active research field with new advances addressing the unique challenges in the domain. However, understanding and evaluating improvements by deriving metrics such as code coverage and unique crashes are problematic, leading to a desire for a reliable bug-based benchmark. To address the need, we design and build FirmReBugger, a holistic framework for fairly assessing monolithic firmware fuzzers with a realistic, diverse, bug-based benchmark. FirmReBugger proposes using bug oracles--C syntax expressions of bug descriptors--with an interpreter to automate analysis and accurately report on bugs discovered, discriminating between states of detected, triggered, reached and not reached. Importantly, our idea of benchmarking does not modify the target binary and simply replays fuzzing seeds to isolate the benchmark implementation from the fuzzer while providing a simple means to extend with new bug oracles. Further, analyzing fuzzing roadblocks, we created FirmBench, a set of diverse, real-world binary targets with 313 software bug oracles. Incorporating our analysis of roadblocks challenging monolithic firmware fuzzing, the bench provides for rapid evaluation of future advances. We implement FirmReBugger in a FuzzBench-for-Firmware type service and use FirmBench to evaluate 9 state-of-the art monolithic firmware fuzzers in the style of a reproducibility study, using a 10 CPU-year effort, to report our findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided.

We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration.

To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL.

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well.

Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes.

Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark.

First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs.

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "ErrorMap\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u62c6\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7279\u7684'\u5931\u8d25\u7b7e\u540d'\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6240\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u8303\u56f4\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u76f2\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u8c03\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f7f\u57fa\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5e94\u7528ErrorMap\u751f\u6210ErrorAtlas\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u76ee\u524dLLM\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8f83\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5982\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u9057\u6f0f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ea\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bf4\u660e\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002ErrorMap\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684'\u5931\u8d25\u7b7e\u540d'\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u66f4\u52a0\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "ErrorMap\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u671f\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684'\u5931\u8d25\u7b7e\u540d'\u3002\u5b83\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf935\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c83\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u4e86ErrorAtlas\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u76ee\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u5927\u7ea683\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e86ErrorAtlas\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u9057\u6f0f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4ee5\u53ca\u95ee\u9898\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "ErrorMap\u548cErrorAtlas\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u5931\u8d25\u800c\u975e\u6210\u529f\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u5ea6\u91cf\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u5212\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5e03\u5b9a\u671f\u66f4\u65b0ErrorAtlas\u3002"}}

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise.

It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT).

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR.

We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present.

Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgriPINN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u53d7\u6c34\u538b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f5c\u7269\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f5c\u7269\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AgriPINN\u3002", "method": "AgriPINN\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u4f5c\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u7ea6\u675f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5e72\u65f1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53f6\u9762\u79ef\u6307\u6570\u3001\u5438\u6536\u7684\u5149\u5408\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5fb7\u56fd397\u4e2a\u5730\u533a60\u5e74\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6c34\u5206\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u5e74\u7684\u7530\u95f4\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer\uff09\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08LINTUL5\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAgriPINN\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8643%\u3002", "conclusion": "AgriPINN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u704c\u6e89\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens).
